2009-07-09T14:07:00.000Z	richardcavell		Hey I'm using Chatzilla. Is there a short way to reply to people by including their name and a colon, or do I just type it?
2009-07-09T14:08:00.000Z	richardcavell		I used to use IRC about 10 years ago and I'm surprised that these IRC programs haven't improved much since then
2009-07-09T14:09:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	What are you looking for?  Smiley feature? :)
2009-07-09T14:10:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I still find it difficult to find a channel that suits me, see whether users are active in the channel, there's still a whole lot of technical text to read
2009-07-09T14:11:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	You're using Chatzilla?  Try using different IRC clients and themes.
2009-07-09T14:11:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	different clients and themes?
2009-07-09T14:12:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Sure.  Paste screenshot.  I'll paste mine. :)
2009-07-09T14:13:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	How do I post my screenshot?
2009-07-09T14:13:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	ImageShack
2009-07-09T14:15:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6237/screenshotgze.png << My screenshot
2009-07-09T14:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Here you go.  You didn't customize anything to your likings. :)
2009-07-09T14:18:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I don't know how to customize it
2009-07-09T14:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	You ever try XChat?  It's an IRC client.  Use that instead of Firefox Addons. :)
2009-07-09T14:19:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	you said you'd post your screenshot, now where is it?
2009-07-09T14:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Let me send you ... Yeah that.
2009-07-09T14:19:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I was using xchat before but it hangs on me when updating channel list
2009-07-09T14:20:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	http://tinyurl.com/koshx8
2009-07-09T14:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	I find XChat better than Chatzilla IMO.  It still run in background.  You're depending on Firefox. :0
2009-07-09T14:22:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I was using XChat before but it hangs on me when I go to update channel lists on freenode
2009-07-09T14:23:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Give it a try now.  I doubt it would occur.
2009-07-09T14:39:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Enjoying the highlights so far?
2009-07-09T14:40:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	Mine doesn't look as good as yours
2009-07-09T14:40:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	This is Ubuntu Support Channel.  There also are Ubuntu Offtopic Channel where you can discuss just about anything.
2009-07-09T14:40:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	I know.  I used a theme.
2009-07-09T14:40:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	http://t0x.in/xchatthemes.html
2009-07-09T14:41:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I appreciate that this is the official channel, but I don't know my way around IRC much. Is this the best Ubuntu IRC channel out there?
2009-07-09T14:55:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Nice!  XChat Black?
2009-07-09T14:43:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	This is Ubuntu Offical Support Channel (only in English).  There are several languages but yes, this is "best" Ubuntu IRC channel (as in this is the only one0.
2009-07-09T14:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I am running xchat with a theme now
2009-07-09T14:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	XChat-white-color
2009-07-09T14:56:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	how do I list all the users at the right like you have it?
2009-07-09T14:56:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	CTRL + F7.  It's also in View -->
2009-07-09T14:57:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	no it's not
2009-07-09T14:57:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	What do you mean?  It's not therre?  View --> User List ?
2009-07-09T14:59:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I don't have that in my view menu
2009-07-09T15:00:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	2.8.6-2.1ubuntu4
2009-07-09T15:00:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	I think you have xchat-gnome -- not same thing as xchat
2009-07-09T15:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	That only happen when you switch tabs.
2009-07-09T15:23:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	Okay. Now how do I make messages to my nickname stand out more?
2009-07-09T15:23:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	at the moment they're in red but I'm color blind and I'd prefer it to flash or something
2009-07-09T15:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	I'll look up something for you.
2009-07-09T15:28:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	^^
2009-07-09T15:33:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	You see it?
2009-07-09T15:37:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I'm currently experimenting
2009-07-09T15:37:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	my current theme is difficult to read on laptop screen
2009-07-09T15:37:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Windows Flag + M (If that help you).
2009-07-09T15:38:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I'm on a Mac
2009-07-09T15:39:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	all I want is all black text on white but if a message contains my nickname it stands out
2009-07-09T15:41:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	You might have to edit colors for that one.  Mac?  If you're running Ubuntu, there are "negative film" effect on SUPER + M.  You would have to edit colors and that's hassle in XChat. You could opt for seperate message tab.  (See @highlight tab?)
2009-07-09T15:41:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I'm just going to change all the colors manually
2009-07-09T15:43:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Alright. :)
2009-07-09T16:01:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I've installed the blue theme now. It's working much better!
2009-07-09T16:01:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Yay! <3
2009-07-09T16:01:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	yeah. The blue theme looks much better on my laptop screen.
2009-07-09T16:03:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Got anything else you might want to know about?
2009-07-09T16:04:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I'm still testing this
2009-07-09T16:04:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	how do I make it go some color other than red when someone mentions me?  I'm color blind and red looks weird to me
2009-07-09T16:12:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Sorry.  Didn't see you there.  It's in Options.  (Highlight color).
2009-07-09T16:12:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Preferences*
2009-07-09T16:12:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I've changed it but it's still red
2009-07-09T16:13:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	How can you tell?  Lol.
2009-07-09T16:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Take a screenshot and I'll tell you?
2009-07-09T16:14:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	hang on a tic I'm making it play a sound when my nick is mentioned
2009-07-09T16:15:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Use libnotify (it's in link I sent you).  It's really nice.  I'm testing it too.
2009-07-09T16:16:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I don't need to. It can play a sound when a message is highlighted.
2009-07-09T16:18:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	do you have any nice alarm sounds I can use? I'm searching the net but can't find any good ones
2009-07-09T16:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	You're color-blind.  I'm deaf. :X
2009-07-09T16:19:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	currently I have the MIB theme playing every time my name is mentioned, so every time you mention me, Will Smith starts singing
2009-07-09T16:20:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	You could use sleep, I think.  "sleep 3h && vlc MIB.avi"   Sleep for 3 hours and it'll start running MIB movie.
2009-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	seriously, every time you talk to me Will Smith starts singing and I have to turn him off manually
2009-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Pick a small audio.  Not a song. :0
2009-07-09T17:30:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	Okay, I think I'm set up now
2009-07-09T17:30:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Good.  You can see my message better?  Heard my song too?
2009-07-09T17:31:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I can see your message much better now. It's in yellow. You now make a doorbell sound
2009-07-09T17:31:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	hey can you pm me just to test?
2009-07-09T18:27:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	why are you advising people to sleep and then load firefox?
2009-07-09T18:27:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	It can be used as a timer.
2009-07-09T18:28:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	It was just an example.  You can use it to run audio for wake-up calls and such. ;3
2009-07-09T18:28:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	yeah, I realise
2009-07-09T18:29:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	anyway, mobi I have xchat all set up now
2009-07-09T18:29:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	Sreenshot!

2009-07-10T08:23:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	I don't understand. The guy wants to code for an Ubuntu project. That's on topic.
2009-07-10T08:23:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	richardcavell	That was a different person. :3
2009-07-10T14:27:00.000Z	richardcavell	mobi-sheep	still here...?
