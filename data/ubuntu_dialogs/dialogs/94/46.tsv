2008-11-27T04:49:00.000Z	mrwes		why not run ircii :)
2008-11-27T04:50:00.000Z	mrwes		ircii and lynx :) both rox
2008-11-27T04:50:00.000Z	mrwes		heh
2008-11-27T04:50:00.000Z	mrwes		kb00m!
2008-11-27T04:51:00.000Z	mrwes		kb that ass will ya
2008-11-27T04:51:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	that's completely unwarranted.
2008-12-06T19:49:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	who or w
2008-12-06T19:51:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	is a pts/0 an ssh login?
2008-12-13T04:00:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	lots of house keepin' aye?
2008-12-13T04:01:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	any idea why open office 3.0 isn't available in the repos for Hardy, only Ibex?
2008-12-13T04:01:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	ppa repos that is
2008-12-13T04:02:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	no, don't know
2008-12-13T04:02:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	K...doesn't make sense not to have them for a LTS version, at least not to me
2008-12-13T04:03:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	there were issues with those packages, don't know if only the hardy version, or also the intrepid version, or both - they might come later
2008-12-13T04:03:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I have OO 3.0 installed on my Ibex laptop, seems to work Ok, but they're not availabel for Hardy
2009-03-19T23:10:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	thanks for the clariification
2009-03-19T23:15:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	what's the +s do?
2009-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	what i just said - the setuid group bit, on a directory, makes all new files inherit the directory's permissions
2009-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yah yah...I understand the letter g = group, I'm just not familiar with the +s
2009-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	s *is* the setuid
2009-03-20T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	uh... if it's portable and you might want to connect it to Windows computers, i'm not sure - i'd be wondering about ext3 vs NTFS
2009-03-20T19:45:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	/ dennda : well it'l be connected to my server -- static. I have a small 30gb drive w/ enclosure I use to for portability
2009-03-20T19:45:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	then ext3 should be fine
2009-03-20T19:45:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	: ok.. thanks -- that's the plan then
2009-03-20T19:46:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	that'll take what? couple of days? heh
2009-03-20T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	formatting it? nah...
2009-03-20T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	just do a quick format
2009-03-20T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	(i.e. the standard mkfs format)
2009-03-20T19:47:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	mkfs -t ext3
2009-03-20T22:33:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	thanks -- that even works on my server :)
2009-03-20T22:32:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	sudo update-alternatives --config editor
2009-03-21T23:23:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	right, but let's do one thing at a time - since i suspect her main HD might be full, which is a Bad Thing (tm)
2009-03-21T23:24:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	gotcha
2009-03-24T03:25:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	sorry?
2009-03-31T04:35:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	isn't screen a bit overkill?
2009-03-31T04:35:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yah I guess so :)
2009-03-31T04:36:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	guess it depends on the process he wants to run
2009-03-31T04:36:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	well he did mention gedit
2009-03-31T04:37:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	err, what does gemanding have to do with it?
2009-03-31T04:37:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	it was a joke :(
2009-04-05T18:28:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	i see. but then you wouldn't run a daemon directly from the console, with or without sudo, no?
2009-04-05T18:29:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yes /etc/init.d/clamdscan
2009-04-05T18:29:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	with sudo of course :)
2009-04-05T18:30:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	even better - invoke-rc.d clamdscan start/stop
2009-04-05T18:30:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yah I always get lost on the rc.d stuff :) -- besides won't the daemon start on bootup?
2009-04-05T18:31:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	i'm not sure about that, there might be something in /etc/default that prevents it. i'm installing it now
2009-04-05T18:31:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	well I could reboot my server too see :)
2009-04-05T18:32:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	several daemons in ubuntu are set up to not start by default unless you touch stuff in /etc/default, so that's just a guess but not a random one
2009-04-05T18:32:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	how do you add a daemon to rc.d ? sudo /etc/init.d/clamdscan > update rc.d ?
2009-04-05T18:35:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	no, sudo update-rc.d daemonname defaults
2009-04-05T18:35:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	or something else if you don't want the default
2009-04-05T18:44:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	clamd started on reboot of my server
2009-04-05T18:45:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	it starts by default, yes, you didn't really have to reboot to ensure :)
2009-04-05T18:45:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yah I just wanted to make sure :)
2009-04-05T18:46:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I really just want clamd to monitor my samba share, but I don't see where in the clamd.conf file to set that
2009-04-05T18:49:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	i get the feeling that clamd never really does anything unless instructed... so if that's true, then you tell it which directory to scan simply by running clamdscan on it
2009-04-05T18:49:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	Ok..I get it, so it's really not realtime monitoring
2009-04-05T18:50:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	it's really setup for user level scanning via clamdscan
2009-04-05T18:50:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	it looks that way to me
2009-04-05T18:50:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	same here
2009-04-05T19:51:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	does this looks correct for a incrontab:  /media/external IN_CREATE IN_MODIFY clamscan -av $@/$# $%
2009-04-05T19:52:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	wait, i've never actually *used* incron to begin with :)
2009-04-05T19:52:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	Ok...I modified a file in that directory, and monitored htop and I didn't see clamscan run
2009-04-05T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	perhaps it ran very quickly - doesn't it have logs?
2009-04-05T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	(also, i suspect it would be better to use clamdscan there)
2009-04-05T19:53:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	lemme check
2009-04-05T19:58:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I don't think the wildcards are correct
2009-04-05T19:58:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	does this looks correct for a incrontab:  /media/external IN_CREATE IN_MODIFY clamscan -av $@/$# $%
2009-04-05T20:00:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	why are you putting $% at the end?
2009-04-05T20:01:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	hrmm...maybe I don't need that event flag
2009-04-05T20:02:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	i don't think so, clamscan only wants a filename...
2009-04-05T20:02:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	ok..I took that off and changed it to run clamdscan
2009-04-05T20:02:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	also, the doc seems to say you should use commas (not a space) between IN_CREATE and IN_MODIFY
2009-04-05T20:03:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	ahh...I was wonder about too :)
2009-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I also added NO-IN_LOOP to turn off monitoring until the scan is done
2009-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	i don't think that'd be necessary
2009-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	if you're using clamdscan, then it ought to be queuing scan requests...
2009-04-05T20:05:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I don't know what that means -- oh, you mean that will show up as a process?
2009-04-05T20:06:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	you said that NO-IN_LOOP will avoid calling clamscan if clamscan is already being run for another file, is that correct?
2009-04-05T20:06:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yah -- according to the docs
2009-04-05T20:08:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	yeah, your idea would mean that you'd end up risking to NOT SCAN some files
2009-04-05T20:08:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	so just ditch it, use clamdscan so you're sure every file will be scanned
2009-04-05T20:08:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I see your point
2009-04-05T20:11:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	I don't see anything in the /var/log/clamav.log that it ran
2009-04-05T20:12:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	well for that matter i don't see anything in that log file even when i run it manually
2009-04-05T20:13:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	where the heck does clamd or clamdscan output too?
2009-04-05T20:15:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	i don't know. look, how about you just put a >> redirect to some file in /tmp or something, right into the clamdscan command line in incron
2009-04-05T20:15:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	(and use -v for verbose)
2009-04-05T20:15:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	yah...
2009-04-05T20:19:00.000Z	mrwes	LjL	no output...sigh...
2009-04-11T06:50:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	no, it's just i used it too quickly in succession on the same factoid.
2009-04-25T02:26:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	err, given it contains virtually no packages - no?
2009-04-25T02:27:00.000Z	LjL	mrwes	its purpose is having a very small cd to install from, that's all
