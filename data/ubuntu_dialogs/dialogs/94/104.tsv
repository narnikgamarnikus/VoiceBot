2006-01-24T13:31:00.000Z	ReDeemer		i've got a problem with my vid drivers
2006-01-24T13:31:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	what's up?
2006-01-24T13:32:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	I mean, what is your current drivers doing?
2006-01-24T13:32:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	how are you installing them, through apt or with their program?
2006-01-24T13:33:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	I know it needs at least the headers, don't think it needs the source though
2006-01-24T13:33:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	What kernel version are you using now?
2006-01-24T13:34:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	You don't need to install all the headers...in fact you shouldn't...you only need the headers for your kernel
2006-01-24T13:34:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	or kernels, if you need to use more than one
2006-01-24T13:35:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok, can you try and fetch the nvidia kernel packages again, and tell me the exact error it gives?
2006-01-24T13:36:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	Oh ok, I'll wait
2006-01-24T13:37:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	Not necessarily, but it makes things confusing
2006-01-24T13:38:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	It takes alot of space though, and in rare cases can cause conflicts
2006-01-24T13:41:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	also, while you are in there, see if any of the linux-restricted-modules are installed
2006-01-24T13:48:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	haveta reboot?
2006-01-24T13:49:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok, phase 2
2006-01-24T13:49:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	yes, you will need that
2006-01-24T13:49:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	btw, what package is specifically asking for this?
2006-01-24T13:50:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	which apt package, nvidia-kernel-source, nvidia-glx, etc?
2006-01-24T13:50:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	or can you tell?
2006-01-24T13:51:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	oh, I see
2006-01-24T13:51:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	in that case, the situation is different
2006-01-24T13:52:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	uh, hang on
2006-01-24T13:53:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	or do you want a private chat?
2006-01-24T13:55:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok...as I was saying
2006-01-24T13:56:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	if you want to use nvidia's installer, you must uninstall all packages relating to nvidia
2006-01-24T13:57:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	This means nvidia-kernel packages, nvidia-glx packages, and if they contain the nvidia drives, the linux-resitricted-modules packages
2006-01-24T14:08:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	try it again?
2006-01-24T14:10:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	eh, everyone get's their one mistake, google for pastebin
2006-01-24T14:11:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	new plan, use tracy's link
2006-01-24T14:14:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	well, let's see
2006-01-24T14:14:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	I think I know what's wrong here...
2006-01-24T14:14:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	Even though I only got part of that message
2006-01-24T14:15:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	the nvidia package needs something a little...well, special
2006-01-24T14:15:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	get to a terminal (window, CLI, something), log in as root or su, and go to the directory /usr/src
2006-01-24T14:18:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	are you ok?
2006-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	hey
2006-01-24T14:22:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	yes
2006-01-24T14:22:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	did you send any more...may not have gotten those
2006-01-24T14:28:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok, now list the directory (ls) and look at all the header directories
2006-01-24T14:28:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	there should be one for your kernel
2006-01-24T14:28:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	type uname -r to see what kernel version you need, just to be sure
2006-01-24T14:29:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	once you get that, run this command (make sure you are root)
2006-01-24T14:29:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ln -s linux-headers-version-you-need-directory linux
2006-01-24T14:32:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	yes
2006-01-24T14:33:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	once that is done, make sure you have a /usr/src/linux directory...then you need to make sure that you are ready to install
2006-01-24T14:35:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	do you mean it's light blue in the terminal?
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	uh oh...that middle placeholder you put your thing into...make sure that's an actual directory in /usr/src
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	have a sneaking suspision(sp) that it's not
2006-01-24T14:37:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	sorry...the directory name after the ln -s
2006-01-24T14:38:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	it should pre-exist in /usr/src
2006-01-24T14:39:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	no, it means that you for some reason do not have the linux-headers package for your particular kernel
2006-01-24T14:39:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	(unfortunately, that means more apt mayhem...try to find the linux-headers package that matches the version given by uname -r )
2006-01-24T14:40:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	odd
2006-01-24T14:40:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	use that pastebin thing to give me the directory listing of /usr/src, and the output of uname -r
2006-01-24T14:44:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	command should have worked the first time...let's try it again
2006-01-24T14:45:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	get to /usr/src in a terminal, and type
2006-01-24T14:45:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	rm linux
2006-01-24T14:45:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ln -s linux-headers-2.6.12-10-amd64-generic linux
2006-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	probably linux already existed, and we confused it
2006-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	yes, it is, we are kind of fooling the nvidia installer
2006-01-24T14:47:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	now make absolutely sure nvidia-* and linux-restricted-modules packages are not on your machine
2006-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	otherwise, unexpected things may happen
2006-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	k
2006-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	don't worry about nv
2006-01-24T14:48:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	jsut nvidia
2006-01-24T14:49:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	scrap it
2006-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	same thing
2006-01-24T14:51:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	can you pastebin some more details>
2006-01-24T14:51:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok, phew
2006-01-24T14:54:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok, now before you go installing it, one last thing
2006-01-24T14:54:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	Just in case you don't know (if you read the README you will), make sure to change your xorg.conf file...DO NOT LET THE INSTALLER DO THIS FOR YOU
2006-01-24T14:55:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	it's rather buggy, and messed up my config file
2006-01-24T14:55:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ok...hang on a sec, gotta make sure I'm right on this
2006-01-24T14:57:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	hang on, browser is freaking out
2006-01-24T14:59:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	the file to edit is /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-01-24T15:00:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	don't edit it now, suggest writing this down for after you install the nvidia module
2006-01-24T15:00:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ahh, ok
2006-01-24T15:01:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	in the Module section, comment out lines with dri or GLCore...make sure the line with glx is intact
2006-01-24T15:01:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	and under the Device section, change Driver "nv" or whatever to say Driver "nvidia"
2006-01-24T15:01:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	and you're good
2006-01-24T15:05:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	Im anxious...
2006-01-24T15:08:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	Thankfully, this is an easy fix
2006-01-24T15:09:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	for the sake of my fingers, your install file shall henceforth be known as ./nvidia
2006-01-24T15:09:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	run this command instead
2006-01-24T15:09:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	actually, first, run this in a terminal window, just to make sure
2006-01-24T15:09:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	apt-get install gcc-3.4
2006-01-24T15:10:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	ahh, then you are good to go
2006-01-24T15:10:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	use this command
2006-01-24T15:10:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	CC=gcc-3.4 ./nvidia
2006-01-24T15:11:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	when you go to install the driver
2006-01-24T15:16:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	something wen't wrong, that command didn't take
2006-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	no
2006-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	case sensetive
2006-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	redwolf	ReDeemer	CC=gcc-3.4
