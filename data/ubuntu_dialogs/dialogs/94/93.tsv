2006-08-29T16:28:00.000Z	oscuro		guys, I have a big problem, I don't know why, but lately this machine isn't connecting to the internet.
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	oscuro		I thought first it was the isp, but then I can see my neighbour, who I share connection with.
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	oscuro		and he has connection.
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	oscuro		I look at the net configuration, and everything seems to be ok.
2006-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	how exactly do you share the connection? dsl rouer?
2006-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	oscuro	nozorro	yes :(
2006-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	oscuro		I don't know what's goin on.
2006-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	oscuro		I'm sure it's something with the linux, since for that downtime.
2006-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	now can you ping the router from your machine?
2006-08-29T16:31:00.000Z	oscuro		the neighbour uses the internet.
2006-08-29T16:32:00.000Z	oscuro		nozorro....I don't know how to do that.
2006-08-29T16:32:00.000Z	oscuro		I'm learning.

2006-08-29T16:42:00.000Z	oscuro		I'll see how to install that brb, and thanks a lot nozorro =)

2006-08-29T16:44:00.000Z	oscuro	nozorro	I'm so loser I don't what's my router address....
2006-08-29T16:45:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	if you don't know that, then you can't connect to the Internet. Not even under Windows. I'm serious.
2006-08-29T16:45:00.000Z	oscuro		the only thing I did in the past in order to connect to internet, was to enable the dhcp in the net configuration :(
2006-08-29T16:48:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	so do you have dhcp enabled now for the corresponding network device? Pls look under System | Administration | Networking
2006-08-29T16:48:00.000Z	oscuro		yes sir.
2006-08-29T16:48:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	so please open terminal seor :-)

2006-08-29T16:57:00.000Z	oscuro		nozorro?
2006-08-29T05:01:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	ok assuming your cables are ok and your machine is *not* connected to the router via usb, maybe it's really best to forget about dhcp and set it all up manually then. but you'd need to know the addresses then. -- sorry, i don't know much about the dncp innards of ubuntu, and it has failed on me several times ...
2006-08-29T05:02:00.000Z	oscuro		it's ok nozorro.
2006-08-29T05:02:00.000Z	oscuro		you helped me really much, I appreciate your attention.
2006-08-29T05:02:00.000Z	oscuro		actually I have internet now, I jus hope this thing keeps like thatn =)
2006-08-29T05:02:00.000Z	oscuro		thank you nozorro.
2006-08-29T05:03:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	pues ya lo has resuelto? :-) -- pls. always check the config. of your dsl router, dhcp especially
2006-08-29T05:04:00.000Z	oscuro		whatever you say officer =D
2006-08-29T05:04:00.000Z	oscuro		I'll keep reading linux stuff.
2006-08-29T05:04:00.000Z	oscuro		I'm so noob.
2006-08-29T05:05:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	happened to me as well, some years ago. and networking will always be somewhat difficult
2006-08-29T05:05:00.000Z	oscuro		I'm kinda confused since I left windows forever.
2006-08-29T05:05:00.000Z	oscuro		lol
2006-08-29T05:05:00.000Z	oscuro		but I'm just going :/
2006-08-29T05:06:00.000Z	oscuro		there's no a single bit of windows in this box yeah :)
2006-08-29T05:06:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	you aren't serious, are you?
2006-08-29T05:06:00.000Z	oscuro	nozorro	lol.
2006-08-29T05:06:00.000Z	oscuro		it was a bad decision?
2006-08-29T05:07:00.000Z	nozorro	oscuro	you'll see :-|
