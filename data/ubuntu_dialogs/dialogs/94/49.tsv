2008-10-30T05:16:00.000Z	Tyrath		just wanted to ask one last thing. is there a way so that when you open up apps in terminal it displays the app name in the header?
2008-10-30T05:17:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	check the preferences.. there's supposed to be some kind of dynamic title thing.. I never got it to work though
2008-10-30T05:19:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	can't find anything :(
2008-10-30T05:19:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	it's in Edit, "Current profile" ..
2008-10-30T05:20:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	but as I said.. I've never been able to make it work sensibly
2008-10-30T05:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	yeh mines already set on replace initial title :(
2008-10-30T05:21:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	yea.. so is mine.. it's never replaced anything so far
2008-10-30T05:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	lol. even on intrepid :/
2008-12-06T15:40:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	ok.. be right back
2008-12-06T15:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	thanks
2008-12-06T15:37:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	seg faults.. someone made a mistake when programming compiz.. not a lot you can do about it
2008-12-06T15:37:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	ah k. then that's not my problem :/
2008-12-06T15:37:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	probably not
2008-12-06T15:38:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	if I give you the dmesg dump over pastebin would you be able to tell me which line is giving me the error message for no webcam audio input?
2008-12-06T15:38:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	or what the problem may be?
2008-12-06T15:38:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	I can't promise anything but I can give it a try
2008-12-06T15:38:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	see what you can do: http://pastebin.com/f733e607c
2008-12-06T15:47:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	how'd you do?
2008-12-06T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	it's a big file.. I see your other sound card I think
2008-12-06T15:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	it's probably something under USB
2008-12-06T15:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	http://pastebin.com/f733e607c
2008-12-06T15:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	sorry
2008-12-06T15:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	that second pastebin was an accident
2008-12-06T15:49:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	if I give you the device's number would that help?
2008-12-06T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	=) no worries.. I've found the webcam and the sound chip.. (looks like a sonixj whatever that is)
2008-12-06T15:50:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	ah cool. do you know why sound isn't working?
2008-12-06T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	it just menations registering a usb sound interface... but it isn't complaining about anything..
2008-12-06T15:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	is it advising I register a usb sound interface or has one already been registered?
2008-12-06T15:51:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	do you see the sound device in your volume properties? does it show up if you do "cat /proc/asound/cards" ?
2008-12-06T15:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	it's there
2008-12-06T15:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	 USB-Audio - USB camera
2008-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	ok.. but not working?
2008-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	ie you can't record anything from it
2008-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	not working :/ and can't record
2008-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	do you get some kind of error message when you try? or just silence?
2008-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	just silence
2008-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	actually
2008-12-06T15:53:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I get silence when I try to call cam test on skype
2008-12-06T15:53:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	but when I try to test my audio settings on skype i get an error message
2008-12-06T15:53:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	might be a skype problem too
2008-12-06T15:53:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I tried recording on gnome-sound-recorder to no avail :/
2008-12-06T15:55:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	what do you make of that?
2008-12-06T15:56:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	hmm... don't really know.. hard to diagnose without some kind of error
2008-12-06T15:57:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	do you use skype?
2008-12-06T15:57:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	yup
2008-12-06T15:59:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	well I was getting an error message before but no-longer for some weird reason - that's after i changed my gnome audio settings
2008-12-06T16:00:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	are there ways to configure mic input other than via gnome?
2008-12-06T16:01:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	well.. there are alsa-configuration tools that doesn't need gnome.. but they don't do anything that the gnome tools doesn't do
2008-12-06T16:01:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	:/
2008-12-06T16:01:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	what's you sound capture settings for Sound Prefs?
2008-12-06T16:02:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	you mean in system, preferences, sound? I use pulseaudio
2008-12-06T16:03:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	and then how do you modify the pulse audio settings?
2008-12-06T16:03:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	oh.. but skype doesn't use pulseaudio. it uses alsa
2008-12-06T16:03:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	so it ignores my pulseaudio settings
2008-12-06T16:04:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	so when you use skype what do you do with the gnome settings?
2008-12-06T16:04:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	ah k
2008-12-06T16:04:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	I just set skype to use hw:Audigy2,0 which is the alsa name of my soundblaster card
2008-12-06T16:04:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	so if skype overrides settings for the cam while running, should I be able to configure microphone settings fully from skype?
2008-12-06T16:05:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	that doesn't come up as an option in my skype :/
2008-12-06T16:06:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	it doesn't really override settings.. alsa is the base system for your system.. it selects a driver for the sound card and makes sound devices available to the system.. pulseaudio uses these devices so you can do neat things like move the sound from one soundcard to another... alsa is still there, behind the scenes, doing the actual work on the sound card
2008-12-06T16:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	do you use camorama?
2008-12-06T16:07:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	skype just ignore pulseaudio.. and goes directly to alsa..gnome-volume-manager also configures the alsa settings.. there is another configuration dialog for pulseaudio
2008-12-06T16:07:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	nope.. my webcam doesn't work with it..
2008-12-06T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	my usb sound card does some weird things with the volume too.. fortunately I can change the volume on my speakers instead
2008-12-06T16:08:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I'm installing gnome-volume-manager now. I didn't have it for some weird reason :/
2008-12-06T16:09:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	hmm.. I think it's installed by default.. odd
2008-12-06T16:10:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	it should be the dialog that pops up if you right click on the little speaker in the top right..
2008-12-06T16:10:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	or rather, right click and select volume control
2008-12-06T16:10:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	sorry.. it's called gnome-volume-control.. not manager
2008-12-06T16:10:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	ah k
2008-12-06T16:11:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I wonder what I just installed... :/
2008-12-06T16:11:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	give it a try =)
2008-12-06T16:11:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I did, but it wouldn't launch under gnome-volume-manager so I'm removing it
2008-12-06T16:11:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	ok
2008-12-06T16:12:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	actually you might be able to help me with something else. For some reason I adjusted some setting and when I click the volume up and volume down buttons on the key board they nolonger do anything
2008-12-06T16:14:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	actually when I select capture on the volume control it shows an X over it as if to say mute
2008-12-06T16:14:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	try unmuting it?
2008-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	additionally when I go into microphone volume settings the microphone is always mute
2008-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	if I unmute it then click close it is remuted when I open it again
2008-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	it might be a driver problem too.. if you can't change the settings
2008-12-06T16:30:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	anyhow thanks for your help
2008-12-06T16:30:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	you're welcome to what little there was of it =)
2008-12-06T16:30:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	i'm distressed that I can no longer use the buttons to make volume changes
2008-12-06T16:30:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I've got no idea what I've changed
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	hopefully a reboot fixes it but I highly dout it
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	mm.. I can't really help you with that.. the extra buttons work on my laptop but I have no idea why.. it just worked out of the box
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	mine did to
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	I've just done something and they no longer work
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	just this evenening
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	I don't even know what software is responsible.. might be gnome.. or X.. or something else
2008-12-06T16:31:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	whilst trying to get the webcam audio input working :/
2008-12-06T16:32:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	don't worry too much, I'll see what a reboot does and cross my fingers
2008-12-06T16:32:00.000Z	Tyrath	Slart	have a good night
2008-12-06T16:32:00.000Z	Slart	Tyrath	you too
