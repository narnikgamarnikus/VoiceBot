2007-04-11T09:25:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		hey guys i also have another question: how can i change my default apps? i know i can do system --> prefs --> preferred apps, but that only lets me do internet browser and email. i would like to change my default application for media files from movie player to VLC (which i can play my proprietary formats)
2007-04-11T09:27:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		any ideas guys?
2007-04-11T09:27:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		my question was:

2007-04-11T09:31:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		haha sorry
2007-04-11T09:31:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		wasnt trying to spam, i left for a sec and wasnt sure when the last time i had posted
2007-04-11T09:32:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	here is a helpful link that shows you all about it: http://linuxfud.wordpress.com/2006/09/03/ubuntu-linux-file-associations/
2007-04-11T09:32:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i'll give it a lookthrough, thanks
2007-04-11T09:33:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	No problem.  Sometimes it helps to Google for key words that are used on other systems... "file type associations" are what Windows calls them.
2007-04-11T09:35:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	yeah i just realized right now, i just spent a bunch of time lookin through stupid documentation but nothing popped out. you guys were my first shot. i would rather talk to people about it if i can. that way im in here and if i can help out i do
2007-04-11T09:36:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	isnt it suppose to change this week?
2007-04-11T12:47:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	the only problem that I have with "Pidgin" is remembering the name.  I have used GAIM for so long that it's kind of burned in my memory.  At least it's not as bad as, say, Linux changing names to something else.
2007-04-11T12:49:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i know gaim was so easy to say too
2007-04-11T12:50:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	but still, the name is more fitting this time around
2007-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	yeah.  I have heard people tell me that AmaroK is one application that is worth installing the KDE libs for.  Personally, Rhythmbox does what I need pretty well, at least until all of the good Internet Radio stations go away.
2007-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i actually use rhythmbox as my default
2007-04-11T13:01:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	For me, the reason that I use Rhythmbox is because it integrates with GNOME really well.  I don't like mixing and matching applications from different desktop environments unless I have to.
2007-04-11T13:02:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i know what ya mean. did i get KDE stuff installed by default? cause i dont remember asking for that stuff
2007-04-11T13:19:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	what defines a primary partition?
2007-04-11T13:20:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	BIOS partitions are "primary" partitions.  Those are the partitions that are defined in the MBR on the drive.  The logical partitions (which live in a primary one) have their own table.
2007-04-11T13:22:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	let me ask you this: i have a 160 gb hd. if i do a couple partitions primary folders in the root, would those all be logical?
2007-04-11T13:23:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i'll look that over and see if i have any questions
2007-04-11T13:23:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	When you need 4 partitions or less, you can use all primary partitions.  When you need 5 or more partitions, some of them are going to be logical partitions.  Which ones those are can be arbitrarily picked by you.
2007-04-11T13:25:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	but is the only difference that the primary ones are the filesystems and the logical ones are just division of sectors?
2007-04-11T13:26:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	because when i did partitions before, dont you define them as a certain filesystem, thus making them all primary ones and limiting you to 4?
2007-04-11T13:27:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	The only real difference is that the BIOS knows how to talk to one set, and the other set is talked to by operating systems who follow a convention.  The concept is the same; for example, when you have four primary partitions with one of them being of type "Extended," the extended partitions are merely regular partitions "inside of" the fourth BIOS/MBR partition.
2007-04-11T13:27:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	You can define the type of partition regardless of whether or not it is a primary or extended one.  There are 255 possible partition types on x86/x86-64 systems that don't use the EFI standard.
2007-04-11T13:28:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	For example, there are partitions that are of type Linux and type "Linux swap."  The Linux partitions can hold any filesystem that Linux can understand (be that ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs3, reiserfs4, xfs, jfs, etc.).
2007-04-11T13:29:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	yeah i get all that, and i know a lil about the different filesystems that linux uses
2007-04-11T13:29:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	but i guess im still not undrestanding the applicable difference
2007-04-11T13:30:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	ok lets do a quick example
2007-04-11T13:30:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	k.  There is no real difference.  The extended partitions were a way to work around the BIOS limitation of 4 partitions, because that limit quickly becomes impractical when you're running a Unix-like system.
2007-04-11T13:31:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	hmm. for linux, there is no specific extended right?
2007-04-11T13:31:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	any partition i make for any filesystem doesnt have to be a primary right?
2007-04-11T13:32:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	Linux follows the same convention as all other PC operating systems.  No, there is no requirements as to what needs to be primary and what needs to be logical.
2007-04-11T13:32:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	Unless, that is, you're running Windows.  Then it must be installed on a primary partition, no ands, ifs, or buts.  :)
2007-04-11T13:32:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	but the original/first must be primary right?
2007-04-11T13:33:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	and is there any advantage to using a primary over a logical?
2007-04-11T13:33:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	im just wondering if it might be treated differently, even if they are theoretically the same
2007-04-11T13:33:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	No, there is no advantages to one over the other.
2007-04-11T13:35:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	any recommended filesystems? i hear something about a log type (ext2/3)?
2007-04-11T13:35:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	I typically use ext3 on Linux systems.
2007-04-11T13:35:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	is ext3 the log type?
2007-04-11T13:36:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	yes, it is a journalled filesystem.  The probability of data loss with it is not as great as ext2 in the event of a sudden power loss.  However, any filesystem can still lose data, journalled or not.
2007-04-11T13:37:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	ReiserFS is also a good choice (version 3; version 4 is not usable by all distributions and so using it makes your system less interoperable with rescue utilities and the like).
2007-04-11T13:37:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i think i'll give it a try. im not sure what partitions to make, although i want to do a home one and a swap one
2007-04-11T13:37:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	For desktop systems, I use one for /, one for ~, and one for swap.
2007-04-11T13:37:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	For servers, though, its an entirely different ball game.  :)
2007-04-11T13:38:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	thats kinda what i was thinking
2007-04-11T13:38:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	about the / ~/ and swap
2007-04-11T13:38:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	reiser makes me think of nazi germany, so im a little reluctant to "give that a try"
2007-04-11T13:39:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	I know some people that swear by ReiserFS 4.  *shrugs*  I am not the type of person to trade interoperability for a little bit of speed, though.
2007-04-11T13:39:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	me neither, i'd rather be safe
2007-04-11T13:40:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	None that I can think of.  ReiserFS 4 does work a little bit faster (at least in terms of human perception) when doing things like deleting TONS of directories and the like.  But such situations aren't frequent for me, so it's not worthwhile.
2007-04-11T13:40:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	I agree with mjbrooks.  ext3 is what you should likely be using.
2007-04-11T13:41:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	mj: you guys have any idea why i would never have a disk manager show up?
2007-04-11T13:41:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	Disk manager?  What do you mean, exactly?
2007-04-11T13:42:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i have two hd's attached with a smaller 80 gb with ubuntu and another 160 with xp that doesnt even work anymore. when i was trying to mount xp, i was always told to go to system --> admin --> disk manager  to try and set it up or do things like partitions etc
2007-04-11T13:43:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	Could you say what 'file -sL /dev/node' would say for that drive, just out of curiosity?
2007-04-11T13:44:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	I am inclined to agree with mjbrooks on that point, too.  Filesystems are not something that you want to experiment with unless you really know what you're doing, or your data isn't that important to you.  :)  Sometimes, you can get bit really hard by something that isn't mainstream.
2007-04-11T13:46:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	did you want me to run that file command?
2007-04-11T13:46:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	If you have the drive there, and it is still doing that, yes.
2007-04-11T13:49:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	whats the command to look at my partions again? its f-something. its not fdisk right?
2007-04-11T13:50:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	You can use "sudo fdisk -l" to list them.
2007-04-11T13:51:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	ok now let me run the command from earlier on the hd
2007-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	writable, but no read permission
2007-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	For the drive?  As root?
2007-04-11T13:52:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	thats for my other hd that has windows on it
2007-04-11T13:53:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	it should be an ntfs or something
2007-04-11T13:53:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	one sec
2007-04-11T13:53:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	did you want me to run it on my current hd runnin ubuntu?
2007-04-11T13:54:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i picked the dev corresponding to the windows hd
2007-04-11T13:54:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	it should look like this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15007/
2007-04-11T13:54:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	The first one is for the entire drive, and the second one is for my Windows Vista (shudder) partition.
2007-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	those are both on the same hd though arent they?
2007-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	my ubuntu and windows are on seperate physical drives
2007-04-11T13:56:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i can do my ubuntu one, lets see
2007-04-11T13:57:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	ok so lets see, for the first on the linux it says it is an ext3 and needs journal recovery
2007-04-11T13:58:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	Yes, those are the same drive.  But, it should work with your Windows drive as well; the overall drive should have a MBR, and then the Windows partition should have information with it, too.  And yes, a running system will be marked as "Needs recovery" because it wasn't cleanly unmounted.
2007-04-11T13:58:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	ok let me try the windows again
2007-04-11T13:59:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	still just saying that its writable, but not readable. which kind of makes sense why we cant see the info
2007-04-11T14:00:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	If you're getting that on your drive hosting Windows, and you're running that command with sudo or otherwise as root, there is a bigger issue, I think.
2007-04-11T14:01:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	am i hosting windows? the hd is just attached via ide cable. i dont think there is any other connection between the two other than the fact i've mounted it once
2007-04-11T14:02:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	plus there may be other problems. for example, originally i had xp home or something. it got corrupt and was having problems. woudlnt even boot. so somehow i got another install alongside it using a pirated xp pro, and i think the time was running out
2007-04-11T14:03:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i should just format it
2007-04-11T14:03:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	but the disk manager seemed like it would be nice, i dont even have it though
2007-04-11T14:04:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	*shrugs*.  I don't really use graphical utilities when command line ones are available, so I don't know about any disk manager.
2007-04-11T14:06:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i know what you mean. if i knew enough to do it all cli i would
2007-04-11T14:07:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	It's so much faster for me.  Now if only I could learn enough to actually fix my wireless driver myself...
2007-04-11T14:07:00.000Z	mbt	MrMakeveli	But then again, kernel hacking is not my forte.
2007-04-11T14:08:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	someday, right?
2007-04-11T14:11:00.000Z	MrMakeveli	mbt	i really should just format it, thank god i was organized before and kept all my stuff in a single folder and seperated appropriately. it was as easy as copying a single folder over. all though most of it was windows apps which i dont even care for anymore haha
