2006-06-06T07:08:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	I don't think so
2006-06-06T07:51:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	did you also follow the restricted formats wiki to the letter?
2006-06-06T07:52:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	yup, pretty much, but I kicked the updater, I hope it'l do more good than bad, so I'm patiently waiting for a dumb proof guide
2006-06-06T07:58:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 you could always try automatix or easyubuntu
2006-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	she won't let linux in her laptop anymore, after, as she says "I've been playing with that for days... not paying attention to her..."
2006-06-06T08:06:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 you need to install LAME then
2006-06-06T08:07:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	how to ?? for linux dummy
2006-06-06T08:10:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 ok i will take you through
2006-06-06T08:10:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 1) open up synaptic package manager
2006-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	thanks
2006-06-06T08:12:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	once your in synaptic do a search for "lame"
2006-06-06T08:13:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 i want you to tick the following boxes "gstreamer0.8-lame" "lame" "lame-extras" and click apply
2006-06-06T08:15:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	that would have me set? it Errors out because of the 6.06 update
2006-06-06T08:15:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 are you saying the packages didnt install?
2006-06-06T08:15:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	got my notes done, what then?
2006-06-06T08:15:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	E: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2006-06-06T08:16:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 you need to close update manger, only one update program (apt-get synaptic update) can run at a time
2006-06-06T08:17:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	then repeat what i said
2006-06-06T08:18:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	is it better to stay in 5.10 then?
2006-06-06T08:18:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	no 6.06 is far better
2006-06-06T08:19:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	then I'll better wait the last half hour, been a looong download here in Monterrey MX
2006-06-06T08:19:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 ok, well let us know when you have upgraded, and i will take you through the mp3 ripping
2006-06-06T08:20:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	thanks, appreciated
2006-06-07T16:55:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 be a bit more specific mate, whats messed up
2006-06-07T16:56:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" from a terminal
2006-06-07T16:56:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	hello again
2006-06-07T16:57:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 hello :)
2006-06-07T16:57:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 can you get into xwindows?
2006-06-07T16:57:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	no
2006-06-07T16:57:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	I've already tried vesa and vga without luck
2006-06-07T16:58:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 ok mate, what error message does it give when it fails to load x
2006-06-07T16:58:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	do you want me make it fail with vesa or vga?
2006-06-07T16:59:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	hadn't memorized erros just yet
2006-06-07T16:59:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 what graphics card does it have ?
2006-06-07T16:59:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 sorry i know you told me yesterday, but i have a small memory and lots of problems :)
2006-06-07T05:00:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	intel 830MG chipset
2006-06-07T05:00:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 did we try the i810 driver?
2006-06-07T05:00:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	negative
2006-06-07T05:01:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	is that the right ne
2006-06-07T05:01:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 ok i suggest you run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and try the i810 driver
2006-06-07T05:02:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 also try to get your monitor settings right - do you know the normal refresh rate and resolution of your monitor
2006-06-07T05:03:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	k, i've chosed that one
2006-06-07T05:04:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	lcd 1400x1050
2006-06-07T05:05:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 since its lcd you can probably get away with autoconfig of the monitor
2006-06-07T05:05:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	Enter an identifier for your video card??
2006-06-07T05:06:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 its just a name, can be anything
2006-06-07T05:06:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 at this point i normally just press enter about 20 times :D
2006-06-07T05:07:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	ok will do
2006-06-07T05:07:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	there were 18 enters and went in autodetect
2006-06-07T05:08:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	everything is blank again
2006-06-07T05:09:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 type "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start"
2006-06-07T05:09:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	last option was to autodetect display, choosed yes
2006-06-07T05:09:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 and let me know what error mesages you get
2006-06-07T05:13:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface). It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X...
2006-06-07T05:14:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 ok that bit isnt imporant, you need to know what went wrong technically, look down
2006-06-07T05:15:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	(EE) VESA(0): No matching mode
2006-06-07T05:15:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	(EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.
2006-06-07T05:15:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	are you sure you saved the changes from dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-06-07T05:16:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	not sure, it went blank while probing configs I guess
2006-06-07T05:17:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg again, but dont use autodetect monitor.  Instead choose simple and tell it the size of your monitor
2006-06-07T05:18:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 by the way, when using the terminal, you can reuse commands you have typed before by using the up and down arrrow keys - so you dont have to keep typing the same commands
2006-06-07T05:19:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	redoing
2006-06-07T05:19:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	memory for the video card in kB?
2006-06-07T05:20:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	kernel framebuffer??
2006-06-07T05:21:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 just say no
2006-06-07T05:22:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	xorg server modules?
2006-06-07T05:24:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	I guess it's better to put them all, right?
2006-06-07T05:25:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 all what?
2006-06-07T05:29:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	done, warning: overwriting possibly-customized configuration file...
2006-06-07T05:30:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 yeah you want to overwrite
2006-06-07T05:30:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 then you want to reboot
2006-06-07T05:31:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	ctrl+alt+del? =)
2006-06-07T05:32:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	yeah that should work
2006-06-07T05:34:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	strange thing is it loads the brown logo and the bunch of OK's in brown just fine
2006-06-07T05:35:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 yeah those are independant of xwindows though
2006-06-07T05:35:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 your not running a live CD are you?
2006-06-07T05:36:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	not I'm running the yesterday working 5.10 updated to 6.06
2006-06-07T05:37:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 are you just getting the same error now?
2006-06-07T05:37:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	nah! I get the blank screen again
2006-06-07T05:37:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	i think the problem is your resolution
2006-06-07T05:38:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	re-reboot?
2006-06-07T05:38:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 no just keep running the reconfigure-xorg until you find a combination that workd
2006-06-07T05:39:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	that would need a reboot though, once in blank screen seems like theres no way to get a prompt
2006-06-07T05:40:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 i think you should download the dapper drake live cd and see if it works
2006-06-07T05:40:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	linky?
2006-06-07T05:41:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	I guess I'd have followed the rule if it's not broken...
2006-06-07T05:42:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 has it ever worked since you updated to dapper?
2006-06-07T05:42:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	never, always blank screen
2006-06-07T05:44:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/ubuntu-releases/6.06/ download the desktop CD and see if it will boot
2006-06-07T05:45:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	I guess I would wait for my CD packs to get delivered
2006-06-07T05:48:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 bye, sorry we couldnt get it working :(
2006-06-07T05:49:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	np, it's software in the end
2006-06-07T05:49:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	skippy81	do I need to file bug or is this user error?
2006-06-07T05:50:00.000Z	skippy81	alex_mayorga	 we wont know until you try the dapper live cd, if it doesnt work with that then definately a bug
