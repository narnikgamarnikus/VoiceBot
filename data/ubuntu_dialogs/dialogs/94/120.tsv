2006-06-13T07:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	hehe
2006-06-15T10:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	it only works if you install it with aptitude
2006-06-15T10:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	true, that's why I only use apt-get here for advice
2006-06-15T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	nothing like having aptitude try to remove something you just installed with apt-get ;)
2006-06-15T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	do you think it'll ever make it into mainline?
2006-06-25T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	http://people.ubuntu.com/~fabbione/irclogs/ ? haven't checked lately

2007-09-03T07:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	why do you keep pasting that? :)
2007-09-03T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	a guy asked for it; then I thought it didn't go through; then he just came back and asked again ;)
2007-10-02T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	how does having net installed stuff affect an iso upgrade? I'd guess there might be some holds and/or conficts
2007-10-02T10:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	It'll download from the net
2008-01-12T08:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	Please explain this problem further
2008-01-12T08:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	Need to make sure my new version doesn't have this problem
2008-01-12T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	Othello was using alacarte as a non-admin user, and was not able to see software sources. Not suprising. I was showing him a bug report (the one that got your attention :) just to show he hadn't been alone
2008-01-12T09:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	Ah, I should really close that bug, it's not a bug
2008-01-12T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	that's what usually happens to mine as well :_)
2008-02-25T08:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	heh, that doesn't sound right
2008-02-25T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	true, though?
2008-02-25T08:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	sure, but i don't really do any motu stuff and wasn't a motu while i was working on it
2008-02-25T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	knew that, but I was thinking present tense :)
2008-02-25T08:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	nickrud	You could just say it was written for ubuntu :)
2008-02-25T08:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Amaranth	you're on the list, good enough for me
