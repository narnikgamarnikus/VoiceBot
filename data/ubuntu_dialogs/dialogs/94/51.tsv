2008-10-31T19:03:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	have you tried googling for you problem?  This was one of the first hits http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=180411
2008-10-31T19:03:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	but i am updating to 8.10 not 6.056
2008-10-31T19:03:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	yes but the solution is probably related
2008-10-31T19:03:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	have you tried to solution proposed by the thread?
2008-10-31T19:04:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	Please follow the instruction on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades carefully.
2008-10-31T19:04:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	yeah, that will help with Ibex
2008-10-31T19:04:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	 I know its from Dapper, but the issue is a rare one and its probably caused by the same bug... Have you tried the workaround yet?
2008-10-31T19:05:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	you mean, fresh install
2008-10-31T19:06:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	have you read https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/146536
2008-10-31T19:08:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	No help there
2008-10-31T19:08:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	thanks anyway
2008-10-31T19:09:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	that is not to perform a distribution upgrade tho
2008-10-31T19:09:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	it also screws up GNOME according to the page
2008-10-31T19:10:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	ok well then I'd do a fresh install if I were you, and if you have a seperate /home partition you don't have to worry about losing your settings
2008-10-31T19:10:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I don't have one as far as i am aware
2008-10-31T19:10:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	just generate a list of installed packages
2008-10-31T19:10:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	you have a /home dir
2008-10-31T19:10:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I do, but it is on my root partition as far as i am aware
2008-10-31T19:11:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	back up /home then when you re-install create a seperate partition for /home, this will make clean installs easier in the future
2008-10-31T19:11:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	 its a little more work but its the best thing you could possibly do, I was a little apprehensive about creating a /home partition but it was the greatest thing I did
2008-10-31T19:11:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I will lose all my software and configs for the software. I recently did a clean install and I am not doing it again. It should be SIMPLE to upgrade. Isn't that a PLUS POINT of Ubuntu anyway.
2008-10-31T19:12:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	it will save you a lot of pain, you can do clean installs, have several different distros installed and they can all share a common /home partition
2008-10-31T19:12:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	well, what about my software installed and software configs. Wallpaper, themes, all the stuff that is kept in random places in /
2008-10-31T19:12:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	yes that is a plus point, but think about it this way... right now something is broken, its unclear what is broken but something IS broken, its preventing you from doing the clean upgrade. Doing a clean fresh install will do 2 things
2008-10-31T19:13:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	it will get rid of what is broken and also it will allow you to create a /home partition
2008-10-31T19:13:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	all of the personalizations should be saved under /home
2008-10-31T19:13:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I will check my partition setup
2008-10-31T19:13:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	you shouldn't save anything except under /home
2008-10-31T19:13:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	besides to write outside of /home you need root privledges
2008-10-31T19:14:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	some things needed to be sudoed into place. /home does not store everything
2008-10-31T19:14:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	i totally understand your pain... doing clean installs sucks under windows, but once you setup a home partition you'll never think of clean installs again in the same way, they are quick, easy and painless... I've switched distributions without a blink because I had a dedicated /home partion
2008-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	what kind of stuff are you saving outside of /home? and why?
2008-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	I can't think of any programs that save user data anywhere else?
2008-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	mainly software and Its config
2008-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	unless you've installed things from souce
2008-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	so the config files _should_ be saved under /home/$USER/.program
2008-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	for instance Konversation, where does it keep it's config, it took hours to setup because I have many irc networks and channels
2008-10-31T19:17:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I also have a large number of external repositories
2008-10-31T19:18:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	like 3rd party repo;s you've added? not an issue backup your sources.d/ and sources and get apt to generate a list of installed packages, then re-install them after the update
2008-10-31T19:18:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	its probably the 3rd party repos that are breaking your upgrade
2008-10-31T19:18:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I disabled them all and it is still broken
2008-10-31T19:18:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	when you upgrade APT looks for intrepid version of the hardy debs if the repos don't have them then apt doesn't know what to do
2008-10-31T19:19:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	right but the hardy debs are still installed
2008-10-31T19:19:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	yeah, so i should change my repos from hardy to intrepid
2008-10-31T19:19:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	and the packages need to be removed and then re-installed
2008-10-31T19:19:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	do you think doing that would work?
2008-10-31T19:19:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	honestly no I would do a clean install.... it sounds like a lot of work but I PROMISE it will save you time... its going to be a nightmare to upgrade all the packages
2008-10-31T19:20:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	where as if you do a clean install you can create the /home which I CAN"T EMPHASIZE enough (if you haven't figured that out yet ;-) )
2008-10-31T19:20:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	well, i have a 40gb hdd, so having a separate /home would really bugger things up for me
2008-10-31T19:23:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	either path you chose to take will be a lot of work (using non supported repos really mucks things ups, and for the most part should be avoided)  but I'm guessing that the odds of the auto-upgrade working are less then 50% the odds of the clean install working are 100%
2008-10-31T19:23:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	I'm not trying to be a prick or a jerk, its just what I've learned through painful experience
2008-10-31T19:24:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	upgrade is supposed to work, i really don't want to clean install
2008-10-31T19:24:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I just don't have the time
2008-10-31T19:24:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	yes it is SUPPOSED to work, I've only seen it work reliably 1 time... From what you've explained to me the getting the upgrade to work will probably take twice as much time as the clean install
2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	Normal upgrades take longer then clean installs
2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	normally about 3-4 hours
2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	well, i will check if i have a /home partition then
2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I have the cd
2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	you probably don't but you do have a /home folder
2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	that explains how to create a /home partition
2008-10-31T19:26:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	looks like running that could really screw up
2008-10-31T19:27:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	either way you've got your self in a bad position
2008-10-31T19:27:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	and getting out is going to take time and be painful
2008-10-31T19:27:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	how is it my fault that ubuntu screwed up like it is not supposed to
2008-10-31T19:27:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	If I were you I'd find an ipod, external HDD to back up too, copy over your entire HDD and then do a complete clean install
2008-10-31T19:28:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	by installing 3rd party repos you've taken yourself outside the supported realm of ubuntu, you are no longer a position they consider when upgrading
2008-10-31T19:28:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	upgrades are supported for supported systems which your system isn't
2008-10-31T19:28:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	that is what happens when you use 3rd party repos
2008-10-31T19:28:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	which by the way could contain malicious software
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	right FINE. I will screw around with my partitioning. I hope to hell my Konversation config is unaffected, it is the important thing
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	if you back it up then you don't have to worry about it
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	Always back up before messing with partitions
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	I cannot back it up, i do not have a clue where konversation keeps it's damn config
2008-10-31T19:30:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	didn't you edit it?
2008-10-31T19:30:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	Konversation is an irc client
2008-10-31T19:30:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	you do the editing in the program itself
2008-10-31T19:30:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	~/.kde/ is where the config files are saved ~ is /home!
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	right
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	backing up /home will protect ALL your settings, unless you installed software that is written by a retarted person that doesn't understand how to save configurations files in linux
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	so, just backup my home folder, format then put it back
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	EVERY single program I've ever used has saved under /home
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	pretty much that should do it!
2008-10-31T19:32:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	Unfortunately, that will leave a lot of crap lying around because of software that is not installed anymore
2008-10-31T19:32:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	what do you mean? that crap is already there, no new crap will be created
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	If i backup home, format then put home back. there will be configs for programs that do not exist anymore
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	that doesn't matter, you can delete them
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	they only take up a few mb of space
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	ok then
2008-10-31T19:34:00.000Z	Hondo_Kitsune	slayton	ok, here goes, starting backup
2008-10-31T19:34:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	again I'm sorry you're in this position but trust me when I say its worth it
2008-10-31T19:34:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	good luck!
2008-10-31T19:34:00.000Z	slayton	Hondo_Kitsune	come back here if you need help, if I'm not around there will be other people who are more the knowledgeable who can help you
