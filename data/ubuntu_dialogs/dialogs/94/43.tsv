2009-02-09T13:06:00.000Z	Aperture_Science		If my NVIDIA drivers cause my xsever to freak out, what are some possible solutions?
2009-02-09T13:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	how does it freek out?
2009-02-09T13:07:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	"Primary Device is not PCI", "(EE) No devices detected" "Connection refused (errno 111)" and lastly "No such process (errno 3)
2009-02-09T13:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	when you boot and get the grub menu choose rescue and there is an option there to reconfigure X
2009-02-09T13:08:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I've tried that.
2009-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	rww might be right.. the stock drivers might not support sli.. check nvidia's site in the linux section for more info on that.
2009-02-09T13:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	np.. you might end up installing 180.xx to get it to work.
2009-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I'm kind of a linux newb. could you explain 180.xx to me?
2009-02-09T13:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	there is a driver on nvidia site for linux and the version number begins with 180.. the xx is for other version info. so a driver that's labeled 180.11 is older than 180.22 or .28..
2009-02-09T13:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	I made the conversion 3 years ago and it's been a never ending learning curve.. once you learn one thing its off to another..
2009-02-09T13:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	I missed it.. what card do you have?
2009-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Nvidia 8800 GT
2009-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	and when you activated the restricted driver in System>admin>hardware drivers .. which one did you choose?
2009-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I've got two options: Version 173, and Version 177 (Recommended). I've tried both, and both resulted in me getting frustrated when X freaked out, and format/reinstall.
2009-02-09T13:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	I have an onboard 8200 and neither of those worked well for me.  What I had to do was remove all programs referencing nvidia by looking in synaptic. Then installing the latest nvidia driver I got from their site.. there is a specific way to do it.. if you don't follow it it'll mess things up again..
2009-02-09T13:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	I would not use envyng
2009-02-09T13:39:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I currently have no drivers installed aside from what's included with the ubuntu clean install, so I have the option of installing the nvidia driver from the site. Do you think you could walk me through it? I'm brand new to linux and the commands are all still very new to me.
2009-02-09T13:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	so you havent' tried either the 177 or 173?
2009-02-09T13:41:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	No. I've tried them both, but both of them resulted in errors I couldn't resolve in xserver, which forced me to format the partition and reinstall ubuntu.
2009-02-09T13:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. do you have a gui running that you can manouver in?
2009-02-09T13:41:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	yup
2009-02-09T13:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	let me look up the link for the new driver. brb
2009-02-09T13:42:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	would it happen to be NVIDIA-Linux-x86-180.22-pkg1.run? If so, I've already taken the liberty of downloading it.
2009-02-09T13:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	yep that's the one.. ok.. go to System>Admin>Synaptic and "search" for nvidia
2009-02-09T13:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	what ever pops up as installed that pertains to nvidia, uninstall it.
2009-02-09T14:38:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	How would I do that?
2009-02-09T13:45:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	installed apps will have the box colored/checked yes?
2009-02-09T13:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	yes
2009-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	should I also remove xserver-xorg-video-nv?
2009-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	no.. that's an opensource driver for nvidia and good for a backup
2009-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	smartdimmer, jockey-gtk?
2009-02-09T13:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	let me reference my synaptic
2009-02-09T13:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	no to both of those
2009-02-09T13:49:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Gotcha. Applying changes.
2009-02-09T13:50:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Done.
2009-02-09T13:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. now the fun part.. 1st where did you save the download?
2009-02-09T13:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	desktop?
2009-02-09T13:51:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Desktop, yes sir.
2009-02-09T13:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. here's the thing. you can't install the driver while the gui is running.. so you're going to learn a whole lot really quick.. no worries though.. I'll walk you through it.
2009-02-09T13:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	first open a termial.. Applications>Accessories>terminal
2009-02-09T13:52:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	already open.
2009-02-09T13:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	type .. sudo apt-get install irssi screen
2009-02-09T13:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	and hit enter
2009-02-09T13:54:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	already did that too. :3
2009-02-09T13:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	really? wow.  ok  type screen
2009-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	okay. I hit enter on the confirmation screen and I'm at a blank terminal with my prompt.
2009-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	now ctrl+a then shift+s
2009-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Now it says 0 bash halfway down the terminal screen.
2009-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	except you're still in the window with the terminal prompt right?
2009-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. type irssi
2009-02-09T14:03:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	okay. Got it.
2009-02-09T14:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	should have made the terminal detach
2009-02-09T14:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	did everthing pretty much go away?
2009-02-09T14:03:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I think so.. I made irssi detatch. I've got a whole terminal screen with the command prompt now.
2009-02-09T14:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	now in the termial type screen -ls .. it will show you the screen session.. the first part of the name is a number . when you see that type screen -r <number> and it will reattach
2009-02-09T14:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	if you have a scratch pad handy write the number down and "screen -ls" and "screen -r <number>"
2009-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	got it.
2009-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	also ctrl+a TAB to change from top to bottom..
2009-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	starting to make sense?
2009-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. write this down Ctrl+alt+F7 = gui
2009-02-09T14:07:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	written down!
2009-02-09T14:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. here we go.. first in the terminal do a ctrl+a d to detach.  Now what you going to do is ctrl+alt+F2 and when you get a terminal prompt then us screen -r <number> to reattach and then ctrl+a tab to get to the irssi portion and let me know you are there.
2009-02-09T14:35:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	No GUI. Just a blank screen with cursor.
2009-02-09T14:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	did you have one of the drivers still loaded in System>Admin>hardware drivers when we started this?
2009-02-09T14:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	k.. go back to sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the reference to nvidia to nv
2009-02-09T14:39:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	do I do this for all instances of "nvidia"?
2009-02-09T14:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	hang on .. let me look at mine
2009-02-09T14:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	only in the "Section "Device" " where it says Driver
2009-02-09T14:42:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Got it. Doing now
2009-02-09T14:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	then when it's done Ctrl+o (that's oh) and enter then ctrl+x to exit. . now sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-02-09T14:44:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Kay. .conf modified. Restarting now.
2009-02-09T14:45:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Now Ctrl-Alt-F7?
2009-02-09T14:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	sure..
2009-02-09T14:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	you'll loose irc but try ctrl+alt+backspace
2009-02-09T14:48:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I didn't lose IRC, nothing happened.
2009-02-09T14:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	is this card an onboard card or seperately mounted?
2009-02-09T14:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	does the machine have an onboard video card too?
2009-02-09T14:49:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	No sir. I'm afraid not.
2009-02-09T14:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	just a sec
2009-02-09T14:50:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I've got two of them in SLI configuration. If necessary, I can rip out my second card as it's not doing anything right now.
2009-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	did you happen to notice any errors on install of the driver?
2009-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	No sir.
2009-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	But there was a few errors in the log.
2009-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	"Failed to load module "type1" (module does not exist, 0)"
2009-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	And "No devices detected"
2009-02-09T14:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	ok.. try this.. sudo apt-get install build-essential
2009-02-09T14:56:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	done.
2009-02-09T14:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	then cd ~/Desktop .. then sudo sh ./<nvidia driver name.run . to reinstall
2009-02-09T14:58:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Alright done.
2009-02-09T14:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	I'd shut down completely this time.. then start back up . sudo shutdown -P now
2009-02-09T14:59:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	Alright. I'll be back in a moment with results.
2009-02-09T15:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Aperture_Science	yep
2009-02-10T10:48:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	I got it working! :3
2009-02-10T13:23:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	Scunizi	you around? I want to properly thank you!
