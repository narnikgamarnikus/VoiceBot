2007-04-08T09:08:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2007-04-08T09:09:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	if it starts after typing that, it will start automaticaly later as well
2007-04-08T09:10:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	thanks
2007-04-14T06:58:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	removing /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php4* should let apache only load php5
2007-04-14T07:02:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	what does this output: grep php /etc/apache2/*.conf
2007-04-14T07:02:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	hold on
2007-04-14T07:03:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	3 entries all found in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
2007-04-14T07:03:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I guess I didn't do a very good search earlier.
2007-04-14T07:04:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	DirectoryIndex and AddType lines?
2007-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml....
2007-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	yes, those should be there ...
2007-04-14T07:11:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	not sure what your looking for, did you want the entries for AddType?
2007-04-14T07:14:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	you removed both php4.load and php4.conf from /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ right?
2007-04-14T07:15:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	corrrect
2007-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	does this give any output? aptitude search php4 | grep ^i
2007-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	oh, nice! and php5 works fine
2007-04-14T07:19:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	?
2007-04-14T07:20:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	php5.load works
2007-04-14T07:22:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	then it sounds like you got it working
2007-04-14T07:22:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	changed <IfModule mod_php4.c> to php5.c
2007-04-14T07:23:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	yes, thanks for all your help
2007-04-14T07:24:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	np, seems you mostly fixed it yourself though ;)
2007-04-14T07:25:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	that's what got me here in the first place, changing stuff without really knowing :)
2007-04-14T07:26:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I'll have to come find you when I decide to install Gallery2 : P
2007-04-14T07:28:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	php5 is compiled with gd support, so you shouldn't have any problems there... except for the usual permission problems I guess
2007-04-14T08:01:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	is it possible for another application, when installed, to put php4.load in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2007-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	cool, still trying to figure things out at this point, much to learn
2007-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	ajehuk: appreciate all the help. when I get the site up and running be sure to check it out........later
2007-04-15T06:37:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	there should be some symlinks called php5.load and php5.conf in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ do you have those?
2007-04-15T06:38:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	i decided to install php4 last night, it seems gallery works witht hat best?, but yes the files are there
2007-04-15T06:39:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I had tried to use php5 but apache kept looking for the php4.load even after I deleted it
2007-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	should only have either php5.* or php4.* in the mods-enabled dir
2007-04-15T06:42:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I had both at one time. But was able to correct the problem, something I was installing I think maybe it wanted apache to use php4?
2007-04-15T06:48:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	there is a php4.load but no config
2007-04-15T06:50:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	try making the conf symlink: ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/php4.conf /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php4.conf
2007-04-15T06:50:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	(with sudo)
2007-04-15T06:50:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	okay, will give it a shot
2007-04-15T06:52:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	should I test that with localhost  with index.php?
2007-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	you'll need to restart apache2 first, then test on a php-file
2007-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	ok
2007-04-15T06:55:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ prompts to open of save file  http://localhost/testphp.php Unable to connect
2007-04-15T06:56:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	hm... I'm looking at your pastebin, when you removed the php5 packages did you just remove them or also purge them?
2007-04-15T06:57:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	i removed those with synaptic
2007-04-15T06:57:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	and libapache2-mod-php5 should also be purged
2007-04-15T06:57:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	in synaptic you can also choose to remove and purge
2007-04-15T06:57:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	/var/cache/apt/archives/libapache2-mod-php5_5.1.6-1ubuntu2.3_i386.deb is that it
2007-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	removing a package only removes the binaries and libraries, the configuration (in /etc/apache2/ for one) remains, purging also removes the config files
2007-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I saw an option to remove completely but was afraid other applications might go down withit
2007-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	oh
2007-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	that would explain a lot :)
2007-04-15T07:02:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	to get a clean start, I would purge all php4* php5* apache2* and libapache2* packages, then install php4 or php5, which should also install apache2 because they depend on it
2007-04-15T07:04:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	ajehuk: excellent, that is what I will do, did the pastebin help any with the troubleshootng?
2007-04-15T07:05:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	yes, very informative :)
2007-04-15T07:06:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	ajehuk: I don't mean to eat and run, but I'm sorta excited about trying this out, thanks for your help again, I'll post back with my results, good or bad :)
2007-04-15T08:17:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	tried to purge apache2/php4/libapache2  after the purge I try to install php4 and it tells me the newest version is already installed
2007-04-15T08:19:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	yet php4 isn't installed?
2007-04-15T08:20:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I purged php4 and I saw a long list of files....
2007-04-15T08:20:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	php4*
2007-04-15T08:20:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	hm... could you paste: "aptitude search apache2 php" ?
2007-04-15T08:21:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	sure
2007-04-15T08:22:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15726/
2007-04-15T08:24:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	the lines starting with c are packages that are uninstalled, but not purged ( c for configfiles)
2007-04-15T08:24:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	the php5 packages are not purged, I would try purging them
2007-04-15T08:25:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	just to make sure, sudo apt-get --purge remove php5
2007-04-15T08:26:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	yes, or sudo aptitude purge php5
2007-04-15T08:26:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	purged says I need to apt-get autoremove some files
2007-04-15T08:27:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	try with aptitude
2007-04-15T08:28:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	used php5 but it looks like mostly php4 files were removed
2007-04-15T08:29:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	make sure you get all php5 packages: aptitude search php5 | grep ^c
2007-04-15T08:30:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	they should come back afterwards when you reinstall php4
2007-04-15T08:30:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	ok, looking
2007-04-15T08:32:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	run sudo aptitude purge on all file listed php5 | grep ^c
2007-04-15T08:33:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	ok, try reinstalling php4 now
2007-04-15T08:33:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	hold on, i mistyped a few
2007-04-15T08:40:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	okay, php4 installed
2007-04-15T08:40:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	working any better now?
2007-04-15T08:42:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I noticed during the php4 install that it said forcing reload of apache, I'm going to test the php4 install
2007-04-15T08:43:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	to be honest with you I think my head is about to explode
2007-04-15T08:44:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	remember to breathe
2007-04-15T08:44:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	it didn't work?
2007-04-15T08:45:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	something is not right.....
2007-04-15T08:45:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	does a <?=phpinfo()?> work?
2007-04-15T08:46:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	should there be a .php test file in /var/www/ that already has the text <?php phpinfo(); ?>
2007-04-15T08:46:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I had to set this up initially last time, why is it still there,  because it doesn't work
2007-04-15T08:47:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	breathing
2007-04-15T08:47:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	it's probably not there from installing, but /var/www doesn't get removed, even when purging...
2007-04-15T08:48:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I just thought since it was a php file that I created from the last php4 install that it would have been removed
2007-04-15T08:48:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	you still get the dialog to open or save file?
2007-04-15T08:49:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	no..............I need to take a break :)
2007-04-15T08:50:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	I'm thinking you might have saved some time by just reinstalling ubuntu, and then install the gallery package ^^
2007-04-15T08:51:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	I think you are right, but the dialog box is gone now
2007-04-15T08:51:00.000Z	reep	tbuss	oh well, but do take a break, I think you've been at it for hours, and I just realized it's 5 in the morning and I should be in bed by now :)
2007-04-15T08:52:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	ok reep, thanks for all you help take it easy
2007-04-15T12:55:00.000Z	tbuss	reep	you around?
