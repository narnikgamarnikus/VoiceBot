2007-10-01T16:04:00.000Z	riotkittie		Cyclopes: you can cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep driver  ... but i'm not sure i've got that 100% right
2007-10-01T16:04:00.000Z	riotkittie		try it and find out :P
2007-10-01T09:46:00.000Z	riotkittie		i need a good usb wifi adapter. if you have one that works with wpa/wpa2 out of the box on 7.04, or isnt a total nightmare to make work, i'd love love love to know brand, model, and revision. if it's an adapter using the ralink, please do not mention it
2007-10-01T09:46:00.000Z	riotkittie		as ralink makes me want to cry like its just killed my puppy.
2007-10-01T09:46:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	why do you want a usb wifi adapter?
2007-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	because i would like to connect to my wireless network, maybe :P
2007-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Well, why not a pci card?
2007-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	because my slots are currently jam packed with sound, video, and eSATA goodness. sound, video, hard drive > wireless
2007-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	or ethernet - wireless bridge
2007-10-01T09:48:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	ethernet's not an option
2007-10-01T09:50:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Does this computer you are working on have an ethernet port?
2007-10-01T09:50:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	this computer does have an ethernet port...
2007-10-01T09:51:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	that would require a cable running into my ethernet port, right?
2007-10-01T09:51:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Yes.
2007-10-01T09:51:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	not happening.
2007-10-01T09:52:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Why not?
2007-10-01T09:52:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Why would  you not want a network cable plugged into the eithernet port?
2007-10-01T09:52:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	because i dont have an extra cable. and my current setup would not allow for it anyway.  and if it did, i would not be inquiring about wireless usb, as i'd have the ability to use wired internet, and have no need :P
2007-10-01T09:53:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	You are not listening!
2007-10-01T09:53:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	your best option is a BRIDGE
2007-10-01T09:54:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	it is the easiest / best / most reliable way to connect to your wireless network.
2007-10-01T09:54:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Do you understand what I am saying?  (wireless bridge)?
2007-10-01T09:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	uhm. no. not really. and even if i did, i don't think i'd see the point. no offense to you.
2007-10-01T09:56:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	yes, please elaborate.
2007-10-01T09:57:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Actually, I think it is I that needs to elaborate.
2007-10-01T09:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	please do.
2007-10-01T09:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	and my apologies as i am fairly clueless about all things networking related :P
2007-10-01T09:58:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	It is a small device that will sit on  your desk next to the PC.  It is called a "wireless bridge" (for short).
2007-10-01T09:59:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	several companies sell them, e.g. D-Link, Linksys, netgear, etc.
2007-10-01T10:01:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	For example, D-Link offers an 802.11b compatible Ethernet-to-wireless bridge, model number DWL-810
2007-10-01T10:01:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	i still don't see the point of having a wireless bridge. and even if i did, i have no desire to spend money
2007-10-01T10:08:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=Wireless+bridge&MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&ht=1&ebaytag1=ebayreg&srchdesc=n&maxRecordsReturned=300&maxRecordsPerPage=50&SortProperty=MetaEndSort
2007-10-01T10:09:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	i don't want a bridge.
2007-10-01T10:10:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	i do not want a network bridge
2007-10-01T10:10:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Ok.
2007-10-01T10:11:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	What kind of internet connection do you have?
2007-10-01T10:12:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	cable
2007-10-01T10:12:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	is this a desktop you are trying to connect to it?
2007-10-01T10:13:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	to your wireless AP.?
2007-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	DO you have another PC in that same room that is connected via wireless connection?  If so, you can just bridge the connection to the other one with crossover.
2007-10-01T10:14:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	and not in the same room?
2007-10-01T10:18:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	If it connects to the AP via ethernet cable, it would be more secure than wireless.  Right?
2007-10-01T10:21:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	yes, i suppose it is. on the other hand, i believe that i've pointed out that wired's not an option.
2007-10-01T10:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	because that would involve killing my hotspot & violating the terms of a contract, or spending money on things i dont really want to buy
2007-10-01T10:24:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	You are connected via hotspot?
2007-10-01T10:25:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	yes
2007-10-01T10:25:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	I thought you said that your internet connection was via cable.
2007-10-01T10:27:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	When you say "hotspot" you are talking about your Wireless Router,  Right?
2007-10-01T10:27:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	oh. the question as phrased led me to believe you were asking what type of connection i had, not what method i was using to connect to that connection
2007-10-01T10:28:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	yea
2007-10-01T10:29:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Or, ... was the Wireless Router provided by the cable company?
2007-10-01T10:29:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	and if it was provided by the cable company, it may only have one ethernet port?
2007-10-01T10:30:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	the router was provided by FON, and it has a single port
2007-10-01T10:30:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Oh, I see....
2007-10-01T10:30:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	"FON" is the cable company?
2007-10-01T10:33:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Is this what your talking about:  http://www.fon.com/en/info/whatsFon ? (This is the first I've heard of "FON").
2007-10-01T10:33:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	yes
2007-10-01T10:35:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	"FON" is software, right?  SO what kind of AP do you have?
2007-10-01T10:36:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	no. wireless routers would be hardware, i believe.
2007-10-01T10:36:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Then what is the device that is transmitting the wireless signal?
2007-10-01T10:37:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	i'm not sure what it is exactly. a rebranded something or other.
2007-10-01T10:37:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	it just a wireless card in your computer?
2007-10-01T10:38:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	What exactly is plugged into the cable modem?
2007-10-01T10:39:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	a usb cord leading to the other box, and the wireless router
2007-10-01T10:41:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	So the wireless router is plugged into the cable modem?  Is that correct?
2007-10-01T10:41:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	yes.
2007-10-01T10:42:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	What kind of wireless router is it?  Linksys or D-link or Belkin or...?
2007-10-01T10:42:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	i have no idea. fon bought them from some company and rebranded them
2007-10-01T10:43:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	If you plug an ethernet cable into one of the ethernet ports of the Wireless Router, you will be operating independly from the wireless network.
2007-10-01T10:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	we've already covered the fact that there is but one port on the router
2007-10-01T10:45:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Oh, so the Wireless Router has only one ehternet port, the WAN port, (and has no LAN ports)?
2007-10-01T10:47:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	I'm sorry, but most Wireless Routers have LAN ports.  I suppose there a few don't, but I was assuming that you'd overlooked the fact that there was an available Wired port.  BUt there is also the option of sharing the connection with the other PC via internet connection sharing and a corssover cable.
2007-10-01T10:49:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	that computer's off most of the time, so no, that's not an option.
2007-10-01T10:50:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Ok, well, sorry.  I don't ever turn any of mine off, and I have several.
2007-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	And I also use an IPcop box
2007-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	IPcop is pretty cool.
2007-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	and a very good security feature too.
2007-10-01T10:55:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Edimax 54 Mbps Wireless USB stick uses the RT2571 chipset and is [apparently]  compatable with Linux.
2007-10-01T11:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	 i know of a number of adapters that are compatible with linux. my own is compatible with linux.
2007-10-01T12:16:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	He may not be able to boot from it simply because it is not set as first boot device in BIOS.
2007-10-01T12:16:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	alanapost has stated they have changed the boot order properly, i believe
2007-10-01T12:17:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Well, for some time now, he has been tryint to mount an audio CD
2007-10-01T12:18:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	We overlooked the fact that he may not have a data CD in the device so...
2007-10-01T12:18:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	 you make my head hurt, you really do.
2007-10-01T12:19:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Thanks for the nice words.
2007-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	trying to help is one thing, and i'm really not trying to be mean here, but you dont seem to be attention to what the people you're trying to help are saying/have said, and then you seem to
2007-10-01T12:23:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	The only way you can help someone is to get detailed information from them about what they are trying to do.  YOu don't seem to understand that fact.  SOrry but like I said; I am only trying to help.
2007-10-01T12:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	i do seem to understand that fact, but let's be honest. i wasnt following the conversation nor trying to assist them, but even i was aware that they'd repeatedly stated they'd changed the boot order in BIOS
2007-10-01T12:25:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Sorry, but I missed that detail.  But Sure glad you didn't :)
2007-10-03T10:21:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Oh, good.  Thanks for the inof.
2007-10-03T13:44:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	Yes, change desktop resolution.
2007-10-03T13:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	usr13	that'd be great, if i wanted to change my desktop resolution. i don't.
2007-10-03T09:50:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	You are correct. Problem is, that it's hard for the helpee to do the tasks he's trying to do and look at the IRC screen the whole time, because if you look away for a few seconds when it's really busy, you have to page way up to find comments that relate to your issue.
2007-10-27T04:56:00.000Z	usr13	riotkittie	very good!  :)
