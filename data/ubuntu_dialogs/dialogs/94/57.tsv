2008-02-29T17:38:00.000Z	Slart		"it might get lost" ? that must be the worst explanation yet ;)
2008-02-29T17:38:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	yeah ... it's far from perfect ... but i couldn't think of a better one :p besides, it's not certain it'll get lost :-)
2008-03-01T04:48:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	nickrud: I'm not sure if starting nautilus as root is better.. at least you can avoid the typos
2008-03-01T04:49:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	true there. But even then you can accidentily move a file or 2 that should've stayed
2008-03-04T20:44:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	oh.. come on.. you can give us something more to work with.. how does it "show up as single core".. what tool are you using?
2008-03-04T20:44:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	yeah ... if i knew what to give ... sec while i ssh to it so i can jst copy it
2008-03-04T20:45:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	under system monitor it shows up as a single one
2008-03-04T20:46:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	hmm... my two cores show up there..that's odd
2008-03-04T20:47:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	it used to show up before on the previous installs
2008-03-04T20:48:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	 erawfish_, http://pastebin.com/f43030351 <-- is the cpuinfo ... athlon 3800+ X2 2ghz
2008-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	how did you produce that info?
2008-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	what do you mean? i did cat /proc/cpuinfo | pastebinit -b http://pastebin.com
2008-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	I have an AMD x2 64bit too..  I can paste my info for comparison
2008-03-04T20:51:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	please do ... at least some comparison then :-)
2008-03-04T20:51:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	here's mine
2008-03-04T20:53:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	I couldn't help noticing.. mine was longer.. much longer =)
2008-03-04T20:54:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	yeah .. yours is twice as long
2008-03-04T20:55:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ah.. you get one section for each core.. that makes sense
2008-03-04T20:56:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	yup ... yet i refuse to reinstall ... so either i find a way to fix it, or i'll stick with a single core
2008-03-04T20:57:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	 what happens if you run a live cd? you get the same info?
2008-03-04T20:57:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	no that runs fine (last time i checked was a few days ago)
2008-03-04T20:58:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	have you changed your kernel? compiled a new one?
2008-03-04T21:27:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	that's the only reason why my server has a desktop isntalled :p so i can use ssh to get the graphical stuff over ^_^
2008-03-04T21:27:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ah.. I've used vnc before.. but that feels really cramped.. =)
2008-03-04T21:28:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	i always used vnc on windows ... but yeah it feels .. "off"
2008-03-13T19:39:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	there are some apps.. acid:rip.. dvd:rip .. hmm.. k9copy
2008-03-13T19:39:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	dvd::rip is the one I've tried and used
2008-03-13T19:39:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	any of those happen to be command line and easy to use as far as you know?
2008-03-13T19:40:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	well.. dvd::rip is pretty easy.. point and click interface..you get previews and most default settings are good
2008-03-13T19:41:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	hmm ... yes ... what i'm currently attempting to achieve is to throw a dvd to my laptop, that would automatically convert it to a .avi and then back to my main box, which puts it onto the backup drive ... that's why i'm preferring a command line version
2008-03-13T19:42:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ah.. well.. dvd::rip is a front end for transcode.. so I guess you could use transcode manually
2008-03-13T19:42:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	right ... *searches for transcode*
2008-03-13T19:48:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	thanks ... seems to have enough options ... *scrolls down* .... jup .... more then enough options
2008-03-13T21:26:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	you can also use pastebinit
2008-03-13T21:27:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	yes.. but that one has some weird german pastebin server as default.. =)
2008-03-13T21:40:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	ubotu doesnt like you anymore :p
2008-03-13T21:41:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	hehe.. I must have been bad in some way
2008-03-14T03:30:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	tell him to search case insensitive, if i'm correct, it's Steam and not steam
2008-03-14T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ah.. didn't know that.. thanks
2008-03-14T03:30:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	you're welcome =)
2008-03-14T03:53:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	Karsyth, if you remove wine/steam, it does not remove all the gcf's ... you can try and do " find / | grep *.gcf " or something along those lines. ...
2008-03-14T16:20:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	no, if you're talking about openssh-server, it also listens to internet connections if they're forwarded
2008-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	huh? you route the connection from the external interface to localhost? is that some kind of security thing?
2008-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	no, sshd listens to both local and external connections by default (it did for me ... )
2008-03-14T16:41:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	yes, that's a burning program
2008-03-26T03:11:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	you can always try to check for filenames, or properties of mp3 files.
2008-05-14T18:14:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	iptables, enable ip_routing and add 2 rules.. or is it just one.. can't really remember
2008-05-14T18:15:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	you might want to install a dhcp server too.. or do as hostf4cekilla suggested.. run ipcop on anything you can find (toaster, remote control.. it works on almost anything =)
2008-10-21T16:39:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	he can't even login ...
2008-10-21T16:40:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	me neither ... until he said how ...
2008-10-21T16:41:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	F-3000 i recommend using recovery mode and use a graphical view from there. Then change the settings. Slart your opinion please.
2008-10-21T16:50:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	and they work when you don't want them to work ...
2008-10-21T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	=)
2008-10-21T16:53:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	caribou_ , mpd is also cli controllable with mpc.
2008-12-06T15:02:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	correct
2008-12-06T23:59:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	isn't that true for everything?
2008-12-06T23:59:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	yea.. suppose it is..
2008-12-14T01:46:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	vlc can read dvds without external codecs if thats what you're talking about.
2008-12-14T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	does it have its own decss library?
2008-12-14T01:47:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	decss? the decrypt libs for dvd's?
2008-12-14T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	yes
2008-12-14T01:48:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	can't say for sure, but i'm able to play all dvds (including encrypted ones) without installing additional packages using just vlc.
2008-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	it can do to just about 64gb with PAE
2008-12-18T21:34:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	is PAE needed on 64-bit ubuntu? I've got to go read up on this.
2008-12-18T21:34:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	no, only on 32bit. But it allows you to use 64gb on 32bit os.
2008-12-18T21:35:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ah.. ok
2008-12-19T03:10:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	#ops? #spam? wouldn't know.
2008-12-20T12:19:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	doesn't just "dmesg | pastebinit" work ?
2008-12-20T12:20:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	not sure actually. I prefer to use tmp files for those things usually.
2008-12-20T12:21:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ok, just checking
2008-12-20T12:22:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	just checked, that also works.
2008-12-22T13:52:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	type dos2unix in a console, nothing else . Then you'll see what it's part of.
2008-12-22T13:53:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	I always forget that neat little feature =)
2008-12-22T13:53:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	command-not-found :-)
2008-12-22T13:55:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	you mean like a smart playlist?
2008-12-22T13:55:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	or physically move the file around?
2008-12-22T13:57:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	not exactly. Say i have a music file from AILD with title Seperation from the album An Ocean Between us. I want the player to physically rename the file to /home/hischild/Music/AILD/An Ocean Between us/01 - Seperation.mp3 (it's the first song of that album)
2008-12-22T13:58:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	ah.. aren't there some tools for that? hang on
2008-12-22T13:59:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	i know there are, but i can't seem to find it. Anyway, /msg ubottu for the fishing :-)
2008-12-22T13:59:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	2 hits with three tries.. I'm sniping, not fishing =)
2008-12-22T14:00:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	ok ok, so it's not fishing, but you get my point.
2008-12-22T14:00:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	indeed
2008-12-25T02:16:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	it can, but usually it doesn't.
2008-12-26T05:07:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	that's called command line?
2008-12-26T16:00:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	ntfsprogs doesn't have a defrag tool?
2008-12-26T16:00:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	I don't think so.. I haven't actually checked though
2008-12-26T16:04:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	apparently there's no real defrag tool. If you can get it to see the real drive in vbox that'd work, otherwise you'll need windows.
2008-12-26T16:05:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	mm.. seems it's hard to make a vm see an usb connected drive..I guess I'll have to boot windows then.. or steal the gf's laptop...
2008-12-26T16:06:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	thanks
2008-12-26T16:06:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	both would work. If you have VMware working somehow, you can still use that.
2008-12-26T16:06:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	just plain virtualbox
2009-01-30T13:40:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	all of us? =)
2009-01-30T13:40:00.000Z	hischild	Slart	it was a typo, i started typing to fast
2009-01-30T13:41:00.000Z	Slart	hischild	=)
