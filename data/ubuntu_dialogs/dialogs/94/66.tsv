2007-09-30T05:43:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		Are there chipset drivers?
2007-09-30T05:43:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		(i've backed up, no worries)
2007-09-30T05:44:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		okay, because I'm worried the function button on my Laptop that Enables the builtin WIFI won't work without chipset drivers, eh?
2007-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		Last question...for downloading drivers purposes...Are USB Sticks plug-and-play?
2007-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		Is there anything wrong with this OS??
2007-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		Jesus.
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		Anyone here successfully play a STEAM game on Ubuntu? (ie. CS, DOD)
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		through Wine obviously
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		so it is definitely possible right?
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	Wilson29thID		that's a make-it-or-break-it for me
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	so you get the DRI fun stuff
2007-09-30T05:43:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	yes
2007-09-30T05:43:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	the installer should walk you through that
2007-09-30T05:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	the kernel should have the stuff built-in, the LiveCD is there for you totest :)
2007-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	yes
2007-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	well, thats what the LiveCD is for, to determine if you encounter any issues that we may be able to help with :)
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	ive set up Wine and co for a friend
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	there are instructions over at the Wine AppDb
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	yes
2007-09-30T05:46:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	you probably have to install restricted drivers for your vid card tho
2007-09-30T05:47:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	yes, lemme hook you up
2007-09-30T05:48:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	http://winehq.org/site/download-deb for adding the Wine BudgetDedicated repo, obviously do this after you instal
2007-09-30T05:48:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	to play 3D games, you'll probably need a restricted driver
2007-09-30T05:49:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=1554 for Steam
2007-09-30T05:49:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	what chipset is your card? Intel?
2007-09-30T05:49:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	Nvidia?
2007-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	ah, Intel
2007-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	then you dont need any restricted drivers at all
2007-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	though, doesn't performance kinda suck? i could be dead wrong tho
2007-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	but yeah
2007-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	yeah, you shouldn't require any other drivers
2007-09-30T05:50:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	buy a video card :)
2007-09-30T05:51:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	oh
2007-09-30T05:51:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	well..another machine then :P
2007-09-30T05:51:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	or be content with less demanding games :)
2007-09-30T05:51:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	lol i see, but yeah, go ahead and test the LiveCD and all
2007-09-30T05:52:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	np
2007-09-30T07:21:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	all the same
2007-09-30T07:21:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	lspci dumps all devices on the PCI bus
2007-09-30T07:21:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	that includes PCMCIA :)
2007-09-30T07:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	cool
2007-09-30T07:26:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-09-30T07:26:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	love this guide :)
2007-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	- Forgive me, I'm new to linux...should I download the Feisty Fawn or Edgy Eft packages (3 each)?
2007-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	you shouldn't need to d/l the packages
2007-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	since you're obviously on the INternet
2007-09-30T07:29:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	just do sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	thats okay
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	you won't be using bcm43xx anyway
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	check this out: http://davidwatson.org/2007/05/broadcom-4306-on-feisty-fawn.html
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	since we are using ndiswrapper, and you didnt need to reboot until the end anyway
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	after you do the whole fwcutter business
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	something I don't personally like
2007-09-30T07:44:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	imho limited wireless functionality
2007-09-30T07:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	just carry on with the ndiswrapper wiki guide :)
2007-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	I've made progress but I'm stuck. I found the driver but it's an installshield file. The guide says to unshield it, and that I may have to install unshield..it doesn't give any commands for such..?
2007-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	sudo apt-get install unshield
2007-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	dont really need it tho
2007-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	unless its wrapped up in a nice InstallShield cap :(
2007-09-30T08:12:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	it's the file that I got off of the ndiswrapper list site. It was an installshield file.
2007-09-30T08:12:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	unshield is probably the ticket
2007-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	the install output "E: Couldn't find package unshield"
2007-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	mm, its here on mine
2007-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	lemme check what repo it is
2007-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	does it come with the default installation?
2007-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	it should
2007-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	got unshield installed? make sure all repos are enabled
2007-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	I did not personally install it, and when I 'add/remove' and search for it, nothing comes up
2007-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	check Synaptic
2007-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	its definitely in the repos
2007-09-30T08:19:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	Synaptic skips from "unattended-upgrades" to "unzip" with no "unshield" in between. I guess it's not installed.
2007-09-30T08:20:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	weeird, mm, do you have all repos enabled
2007-09-30T08:20:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	Settings -> Repositories
2007-09-30T08:22:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	Settings -> Repositories
2007-09-30T08:22:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	it brings up a "Software Sources" window. There isn't a location that implies "all repos enabled" -- Would it make a difference that I'm not connected to the internet on that computer? (Because it says "Downloadable from the Internet")
2007-09-30T08:22:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	ohhhh
2007-09-30T08:23:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	is the computer that you're using hooked to the net?
2007-09-30T08:23:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	well, dumb question, I mean
2007-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	I am on a desktop that is hooked to the net, talkign to you. Next to me is my laptop with my ubuntu install.
2007-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	ahhh
2007-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	where are you trying to do unshield? you cant d/l unshield if not hooked up
2007-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	Wilson29thID	scguy318	I'm trying to unshield the Windows driver for my wifi (the one I got from the list at the guide you gave me)
2007-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	i'll do it for you
2007-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	linkie?
2007-09-30T08:29:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	i think i left u hanging a bit
2007-09-30T08:32:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	actually didnt need unshield :P
2007-09-30T08:32:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	i just ran the installer on Wine, it extracted to a directory
2007-09-30T08:32:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	how do you want me to send the files
2007-09-30T08:33:00.000Z	scguy318	Wilson29thID	sure, PM me your e-mail
