2007-03-14T07:35:00.000Z	cables		Does anyone know how I can change the theme of my KDE apps from within Gnome? I don't have KDE, just lol
2007-03-14T07:35:00.000Z	cables		damn
2007-03-14T07:35:00.000Z	cables		lol went in the wrong window
2007-03-14T07:35:00.000Z	cables		I meant to say, I don't have KDE, just a few KDE apps in Gnome
2007-03-14T07:36:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	uhh qt config program the name escapes me
2007-03-14T07:36:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	I'll look for that
2007-03-14T07:37:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	how 'bout qt4-qtconfig?
2007-03-14T07:37:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	sounds good
2007-04-01T11:40:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	it should be nosmp
2007-04-01T11:40:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	thanks
2007-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	hyperthreading doesnt mean something uses half vs all of the cpu
2007-04-01T11:54:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	doesn't it basically "emulate" a dual-cpu machine, dividing the processor "in half"?
2007-04-01T11:54:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	it's merely a slightly better way to utilize the CPU's resources.  in most cases.  it is not perfect and it will be slower in niche cases
2007-04-01T11:54:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	sort of but it's weidr
2007-04-01T11:54:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	things always use <50% of the cpu with ht enabled
2007-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	hmm it's sort of just splitting the cpu but all the power is still there.  hard to explain i suppose. i dont really know the mechanics of it
2007-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i think it shortens the cpu pipeline
2007-04-01T11:58:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	ok, either way I've established that disabling it helps me encode video faster :)
2007-04-01T10:55:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	digits, nuked_ome1, Ext2 IFS CAN write Ext3
2007-04-01T10:55:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	digits, nuked_ome1, just not with journalling, so you'll have to fsck the drive if windows crashes
2007-04-01T12:16:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	I'm confused... what's kilobits then?
2007-04-01T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	kbits usually.  nobody uses it much
2007-04-01T12:16:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	if you see kb/s in a program, it's kilobytes per second almost undoubtedly.
2007-04-01T12:17:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	file a bug if you'd like it renamed
2007-04-01T12:17:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	I think I shall
2007-04-01T12:48:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	there's only one #
2007-04-01T12:49:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	have you tried virtualbox? I found it a lot easier to set up... and it's free.
2007-04-01T12:50:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i have not tried it.  it didnt not work on 64bit
2007-04-01T12:50:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	thou now that i have a 32bit host i'll give it a shot.  i'd have to use xp32 though as a guest, which seems slower than xp64 for me
2007-04-01T12:50:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	ok. It's nice though :)
2007-04-01T12:51:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	it's really nice for 32-bit stuff. Easy UI, free, some people say it's faster than vmware
2007-04-01T12:51:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	well interesting
2007-04-01T12:51:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	the open source version isn't great.
2007-04-01T12:51:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	but the closed version is free
2007-04-01T12:51:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	yep
2007-04-01T12:54:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	installed on Feisty with .run file. giving it a shot
2007-04-01T12:54:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	they have a .deb!
2007-04-01T12:54:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	edgy/dapper not feisty
2007-04-01T12:54:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	ah.
2007-04-01T13:02:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	post install scripts
2007-04-01T13:02:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	ok. So by that logic, couldn't nvidia-glx run nvidia-xconfig themselves?
2007-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	they could but it's messy.
2007-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	ok, what about an nvidia-easy package or something?
2007-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	they could.  though feisty takes care of it nowadays
2007-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	i have a problem with feisty taking care of it... if you modify your xorg, it gets angry at you.
2007-04-01T13:04:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	it gets feisty does it?
2007-04-01T13:04:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i dont know i havent tried it :)
2007-04-01T13:04:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	it does :)
2007-04-01T13:04:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	neither have I, but I've heard it does... I haven't had to touch it because I'm running in a VM with no acceleration :)
2007-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	did you have problems getting VBox to run initially?
2007-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i added my user to vboxusers group.  still no luck
2007-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	I had to add my user to vboxusers, i think that was it.
2007-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	try running as root, see if it works then.
2007-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i'd rather not but i'll tryt
2007-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	i wouldn't try it...
2007-04-01T13:06:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	root = dangerous :)
2007-04-01T13:06:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	but you know that.
2007-04-01T13:06:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	VBox won't run your existing vmware VMs...
2007-04-01T13:07:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i know that
2007-04-01T13:07:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i created anew
2007-04-01T13:07:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	if you have VBox VMs, make sure that not only are they in ~/, but they're also not owned by root.
2007-04-01T13:07:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	you need to reboot after the vboxusers trick
2007-04-01T13:07:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	actually it is on /media/sda3, owned my Andy atm
2007-04-01T13:08:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	restarted gdm.  group seems to appear when i type in bash (it didn't earlier).  i assume i'm in the group atm
2007-04-06T10:06:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i did
2007-05-22T06:59:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	lol, xbox 2?
2007-06-12T16:53:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	are you using the server version?
2007-06-12T16:53:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	feisty 7.04 desktop
2007-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	you can just set automatic ntp updates from the GUI, no? I have it set up that way...
2007-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	that doesn't work me (nor does doing it manually)
2007-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	previous ubuntu versions and feisty beta were fine.  im not sure what's up with this install
2007-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	that's really screwy... i have no idea.
2007-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	yea it's kinda weird.  is there a way i can log which cron tabs are executed?  i need to verify that the crontab is running properly
2007-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	you might check the system log
2007-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	klog is empty with regards to cron
2007-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	check all the logs, I use Anacron (laptop) and all its stuff is in sysleg.
2007-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	hm..is 'sudo crontab -e' anacron?
2007-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	I have no idea... I don't use cron
2007-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	not at all
2007-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	ah how do i make an anacron job?  i'll just try that
2007-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	cron only runs stuff at the times you set
2007-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	anacron lets you set things in day intervals, and it'll run them whenever possible
2007-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	ah i might need to make it run more often than once a day
2007-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	it gets run on boot, but needs to be called if the computer's going to be on for longer than your interval, but cron actually calls anacron every day.
2007-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	your computer's clock is that bad?
2007-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i guess.  at least on this install it is.  i have no idea
2007-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	that's really messed up... have you tried reinstalling? Maybe some file is messed up
2007-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	yeah a bit uncomfortable with reinstalling atm.  some custom RAID setups i dont want to lose
2007-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	if my hwclock is fine, what's up though?
2007-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	can't i just sync gnome clock to hwclock?
2007-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	i have no idea
2007-06-12T05:00:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i'm using a custom kernel with tickless support.  maybe that's screwing it up
2007-06-12T05:01:00.000Z	xtknight	cables	i think i read about clock drift with realtime patches, not sure though
2007-06-12T05:01:00.000Z	cables	xtknight	I dunno, I'm not at the custom kernel level of linux use :)
