2005-12-04T06:49:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	take me in into the talk while you're there ;)
2005-12-04T06:50:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	TGM: ok, download the latest qemu and kqemu from the author's website
2005-12-04T06:51:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	vmware is fine for directx8
2005-12-04T06:51:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	the source package you mean, i suppose?
2005-12-04T06:51:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	yes - i haven't used the binary as im on amd64
2005-12-04T06:51:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	check
2005-12-04T06:53:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	check
2005-12-04T06:53:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	aw, that was probably my problem
2005-12-04T06:58:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	TGM: everyone ready?
2005-12-04T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	nope... i've had to make up some diskspace for the kernel headers ;-) but i should be fine in few seconds
2005-12-04T07:00:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	aw, hold on, shouldn't ./configure be typed with a "CC=gcc-3.4"?
2005-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	no - it doesn't seem to add this to the makefile for some reason. Im coming to that... ;p
2005-12-04T07:01:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	ok. in that case, i'm ready
2005-12-04T07:02:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	there is no "linux-headers" package per se
2005-12-04T07:03:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	main
2005-12-04T07:06:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	did ./configure run without any warnings?
2005-12-04T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	yes. there is a "no" to a few items, but no warnings per se
2005-12-04T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	kqemu support is "yes"
2005-12-04T07:08:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	manually edit config-host.mak and change gcc to gcc-3.4 on both occasions
2005-12-04T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	done
2005-12-04T07:09:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	Now it's a simple make then sudo make install
2005-12-04T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	let me change that to a sudo checkinstall ;)
2005-12-04T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	hmm, make isn't going well
2005-12-04T07:10:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	checkinstall stops with an error. there is a workaround, but i don't know it
2005-12-04T07:10:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	oh, i'm missing zlib
2005-12-04T07:11:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	when it is installed, do "sudo modprobe kqemu" and run qemu
2005-12-04T07:12:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	it's compiling smoothly, apparently
2005-12-04T07:12:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	excellent!
2005-12-04T07:12:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	the gcc-3.4 thing is the key
2005-12-04T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	do you mind if i re-arrange this "howto" from my irc logs and put it on the wiki?
2005-12-04T07:13:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	i'd be delighted. Give me a mention!
2005-12-04T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	argh,,,, make: *** i386-softmmu: No such file or directory.  Stop.
2005-12-04T07:14:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	it's definitely using gcc-3.4?
2005-12-04T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	looking at make's output, yes
2005-12-04T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	i changed "CC" and "HOST_CC" to "gcc-3.4" in config-host.mak
2005-12-04T07:15:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	that _should_ do the trick
2005-12-04T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	and, indeed, there *is* no i386-softmmu file or directory
2005-12-04T07:18:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	what architecture are you running?
2005-12-04T07:18:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	AMD 32bit
2005-12-04T07:19:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	it is possible to use ./configure to eliminate build targets such as 386-softmmu, but i don't know why yours isn't working
2005-12-04T07:20:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	ok, thanks for your help, and cya
2005-12-04T07:21:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	good luck - you're nearly there! Also check out the howto on the debian-administration site
2005-12-07T15:34:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	well done on the howto
2005-12-07T15:35:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	thanks, i saw you added some info too
2006-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	wget expands URLs that way? cool
2006-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	don't know if whet does, but bash does
2006-09-27T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	ah, well, but bash only know about the files in the current path.....
2006-09-27T11:41:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	you aren't globbing filenames - the {} just makes a range
2006-09-27T11:42:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	right -- but i believed that, in any case, bash would only allow that sort of "pseudo-regexps" when they ended up corresponding to filenames. i was mistaken.
2006-09-27T11:42:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	bash is full of surprises!
2006-09-27T11:42:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	heh
2006-09-28T13:45:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	that's not a major problem if you have managed to get the thing to compile
2006-09-28T13:46:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	might not be a major problem, but still i think it'd be kind of wrong to simply state that "checkinstall makes .deb packages". yes, it does, but there's quite a few caveats
2006-09-28T13:47:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	fair enough
2006-09-28T13:50:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	uhm, well, it don't *think* it should try to remove /usr or /usr/local though, at least unless they're empty...
2006-09-28T13:51:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	it doesn't. That's the point
2006-09-28T13:51:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	ok
2006-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	fyi, it appears that the correct debconf command to get questions asked is dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config   not just fontconfig
2006-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	(ah, wrong channel, but anyway)
2006-10-31T09:54:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	i think i did it once with a plain old dpkg-reconfigure -a
2006-10-31T09:55:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	it does ask about autohinting, but i find it a bit cryptic. it gives a choice of "Native", "Autohinter" and "None", the default being Native - the explanation says "Native" is suggested if you use mainly Bitstream Vera or Microsoft Fonts, "Autohinter" for most other TrueType fonts. I'm giving Autohinter a try (guess i'll have to restart X), though i'll have to find out what these actually mean
2006-11-30T06:29:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	testdisk repairs the partition table
2006-11-30T06:29:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	it tries to detect lost/etc files, in general, and has ad-hoc support for a few formats, including ZIP. look at the description
2006-11-30T06:29:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	photorec (which is bundled with it) can recover deleted zip files
2006-11-30T06:30:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	well, ok, the package's testdisk anyway
2006-12-06T06:41:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	nice about the -F option anyway, i was looking for that some time ago. you sure it's there in Ubuntu, though? it's not in the manpage
2006-12-06T06:41:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	yes it is (in dapper at least)
2006-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	uh, is that the manpage? i don't have it. i'm on edgy though
2006-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	yup
2006-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	would that only force an fsck on the root partition, or all mounted partitions, or what?
2006-12-06T06:43:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	long time since i did it, but i think all mounts
2006-12-06T06:44:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	alright... i'll trust you, unmount /home and try it. i'll beat you if it fscks /home though :-P (when i'm back... which won't be too soon in that case ;)
2006-12-06T06:44:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	don't take my word for it ;)
2006-12-06T06:56:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	success?
2006-12-06T06:56:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	that option might have been removed from the manpage for a reason, since it doesn't appear to work here (it doesn't cause a shutdown, and i have some "rc1 process killed" message on the log terminal)
2006-12-06T06:57:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	worked for bimberi...
2006-12-06T06:57:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	though perhaps it might be because i am executing it with my own (sudo'ed) user (since i don't have root), while /home is unmounted..
2006-12-06T06:58:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	you might need to add the -h or -r flag
2006-12-06T07:05:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	bimberi: alright, worked. (although cron was so very nice to decide to start updatedb a second before i typed umount /home... >:)
2007-02-01T15:52:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	it is in the testdisk package though, that's worth mentioning
2007-02-01T15:53:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	agreed
2009-10-21T20:42:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	atom is x86, no?
2009-10-21T20:43:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	as far as I know, it runs fine on non-atom processors
2009-10-21T20:43:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	yes, it is, but there are variations inside the x86 architecture. i didn't say it won't work (the instruction set should be a subset, i believe), just it may not be optimal
2009-10-21T20:44:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	i'll check my eeepc when I get home, but I think it uses standard repos
2009-10-21T20:44:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	it's possible what i said is only true for 9.10 actually, on second thought. i need to check
2009-10-21T20:45:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	most of the older eeepcs aren't atom, and i have heard they work ok
2009-10-21T20:45:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	well, basically only the 70x and the 900
2009-10-21T20:47:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	i think the atom has SSE3, doesn't it? Apart from that i think it is fairly standard x86...
2009-10-21T20:53:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	antgel: well, feel free to research this better because i'm a bit confused myself. two facts is that there certainly exist an LPIA (low power intel architecture), and that the download page for UNR says an Atom is "required" (though granted, that's a lie in any case). but it might be that only Ubuntu Mobile, and not UNR, currently use LPIA by default, or that UNR is scheduled to do that for 9.10 but doesn't currently. it's also true that i don't see a
2009-10-21T20:54:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	i'll have a look at my netbook when i get home
2009-10-21T21:01:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	i have installed x86 debs on UNR (skype, amazon music downloader etc)
2009-10-21T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	mcphail	the repos might be perfectly standard without the *architecture* being standard. although i admit i'm not seeing much trace of LPIA-compiled packages at archive.ubuntu.com
2009-10-21T21:02:00.000Z	mcphail	LjL	goog point!
