2011-10-24T02:41:00.000Z	MeQuerSat		Don't have a "tv" though
2011-10-24T02:43:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	jason_ here
2011-10-24T02:43:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I really cant place where things went wrong if youre on a 4250 with good results and Im on 6250 with a major headache
2011-10-24T02:46:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	HD5450 I'm on
2011-10-24T02:46:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10 ?
2011-10-24T02:47:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	yes
2011-10-24T02:48:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	when you get to the log-in screen, can you select Ubuntu 2D?
2011-10-24T02:48:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I just logged into unity 3d without issue. (I assume I was in 3d)
2011-10-24T02:48:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I just logged back in to gnome shell but it looks horrible again. white/black panel, square icons all over the place, its completely unreadable.
2011-10-24T02:49:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	what about 2D ?
2011-10-24T02:49:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	unity 2d works fine
2011-10-24T02:49:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	just logged in
2011-10-24T02:50:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	there is no gnome shell 2d, only gnome classic as a fallback if gnome shell doesnt work
2011-10-24T02:50:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	but it doesnt push me to gnome classic. it lets me in gnome shell. it jus tlooks horrible in the process.
2011-10-24T02:51:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	I currently work in Unity 2D, no gnome shell
2011-10-24T02:51:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I really don't like unity and don't ever intend to use it until a lot more changes come about. That said, gnome shell has been flawless for me, so I'll be using that if at all possible.
2011-10-24T02:52:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I just don't get why my video feed is abslutely horrible
2011-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	can't do much else if youre already on latest version/drivers/updates
2011-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	youre one of the few who actually like gnome shell haha
2011-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	except install fedora.
2011-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	actually, no
2011-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	from what I've read gnome shell has a stronger following than unity.
2011-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	based on what I read, yeah.
2011-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	most people I talk to on ubuntu either install something else or just tolerate unity because it works for them out of the box.
2011-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	how would I do that?
2011-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	are they the other driver in the driver menu?
2011-10-24T02:55:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	do you have Synaptic installed?
2011-10-24T02:55:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	yes
2011-10-24T02:56:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	I believe "xserver-xorg-video-radeon" is the open source driver
2011-10-24T02:59:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	uh, its installed..?
2011-10-24T02:59:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	is FGLRX the open source driver?
2011-10-24T03:02:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	No, fglrx is the closed driver
2011-10-24T03:03:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	is it possible you were mistaken on the name of the open source driver? I have FGLRX installed but the package you said you thought was the open source driver is installed too...
2011-10-24T03:03:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	Im not mistaken. As I thought already, you have the open driver installed too
2011-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I have BOTH installed? Could that be conflicting??
2011-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	damn. I was hoping that was an easy fix.
2011-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	open /etc/X11/xorg.conf as root
2011-10-24T03:05:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I'll try this, but I almost hope it doesnt work. I shouldnt have to edit these things these days in linux just to get my video not to completely suck :( anywya what do I edit?
2011-10-24T03:10:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	sorry
2011-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	it seems the closed drivers do conflict with the open ones
2011-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	oh really?
2011-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	did you just google that quick? just curious on where you dug that up at for future reference.
2011-10-24T03:14:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	LOL
2011-10-24T03:14:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I'll use Unity when it's good and ready to be used.
2011-10-24T03:14:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	otherwise, thanks for the info. :)
2011-10-24T03:14:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	Ive tried to get things to work with ati drivers in the past many times
2011-10-24T03:14:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	what things?
2011-10-24T03:15:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	well if that open source driver conflicts, and I can easily uninstall it.... seems easy to me
2011-10-24T03:16:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	yeah, you could give it a try
2011-10-24T03:16:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	fortunately this is a vanilla install, so I can nuke this and not flinch. problem is, I hate doing that, because its only a reminder of how "not ready" linux sometimes feels to me
2011-10-24T03:17:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	you could follow the 2nd link I posted
2011-10-24T03:18:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	if it doesnt work out-of-the-box and its driver related...
2011-10-24T03:18:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	it worked, but see heres what happened.
2011-10-24T03:19:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I had no issues with it originally, but I also didn't use it for weeks/months on end. Im building an Ubuntu HTPC coming in this week and thought, wait, this laptop has HDMI out, I can see what gnome shell looks like on the hdtv. So I hooked it up but couldnt get video. AFterwards I realize I didnt have any proprietary drivers installed, so I installed them and I was able to get the TV to work. Problem was the quality of the
2011-10-24T03:21:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I dont think HDMI had anything to do with it. I think me installing the driver TO GET HDMI to work is where it tanked.
2011-10-24T03:23:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	check this - from #gnome - roasted, those are bugs in the driver, they don't show up in unity because it uses different opengl stuff than gnome-shell does and so does not expose these bugs
2011-10-24T03:24:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	thats probably the reason
2011-10-24T03:24:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	he said a lot of people have had that same issue as me.
2011-10-24T03:25:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	I could give gnome shell a chance and see if it happens to me too
2011-10-24T03:25:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I hate to trouble you with something like that, especially considering it sounds like this is definitely my sisue.
2011-10-24T03:26:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	however, are you using the OS driver or FGLRX?
2011-10-24T03:26:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	fglrx
2011-10-24T03:28:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	theyre telling me if I uninstall all propreitary drivers then the system uses the open source driver by default. Ironically, that's when things ran GREAT, I just couldnt use HDMI (or at least I didnt figure it out)
2011-10-24T03:29:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	sounds familiar
2011-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	installed it
2011-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	ahhh that makes me feel better (even though it sucks)
2011-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	my dear thanks for following through with that. You didn't have to, but it gave me greater piece of mind.
2011-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	thank you!
2011-10-24T03:50:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	still there?
2011-10-24T03:50:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	using fglrx?
2011-10-24T03:51:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	nice. I almost wonder if open soruce drivers would be better to use though? I was googling while you were gone and ati drivers are NOT highly thought of
2011-10-24T03:51:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	it still glitches a bit
2011-10-24T03:52:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	what did you change?
2011-10-24T03:52:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	sec
2011-10-24T03:53:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	I assume youre on 64 bit
2011-10-24T03:53:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	uh, actually Im not even sure what I put on this laptop
2011-10-24T03:55:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	32b
2011-10-24T03:55:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I'd almost just like to get back to where I was before I made the mistake of installing fglrx. Things ran better then, even if I didnt have my hdmi figured out
2011-10-24T03:55:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	Im not sure if this laptop has a 64 bit proc
2011-10-24T03:55:00.000Z	MeQuerSat	roasted	what cpu?
2011-10-24T03:56:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	AMD E-240
2011-10-24T03:56:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	even still, I'd almost just like to get back to how it was :(
2011-10-24T03:57:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	gnome shell worked before I installed the FGLRX monstrosity
2011-10-24T03:57:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I installed it on impulse thinking I needed FGLRX to use hdmi
2011-10-24T03:57:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	now I'm regretting it and almost thinking about doing a fresh install.
2011-10-24T03:58:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I'm just glad I went with nvidia for my HTPC build I'm getting this week.
2011-10-24T03:58:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	this thing I'm doing now is just to "test" how gnome shell would look on the TV when I build the HTPC later.
2011-10-24T03:58:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	this isnt a permanent need to have the laptop hooked up via hdmi. In fact I'll probably never use it again.
2011-10-24T03:59:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	but it's pretty evident ATI drivers have a ton of bugs that need fixed. Then again, for the benefit of ATI's reputation I'd like to assume thse are new bugs as of 11.10's release.
2011-10-24T03:59:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	open drivers WORKED for me (without hdmi)
2011-10-24T03:59:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	now that I've given up on the hdmi thing I'd like to have the laptop usable... something FGLRX just FUBAR'd.

2011-10-24T04:01:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	I see. I just wonder how to get back...
2011-10-24T04:01:00.000Z	roasted	MeQuerSat	Im fearing a fresh install is upon me...
