2007-04-29T11:20:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	wget http://www.somewhere.com/path/to/flash.swf
2007-04-29T11:21:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	tools > page info   might work too
2007-04-29T11:21:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	the media tab should list flash stuff and the you can "save as"
2007-04-29T11:26:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	is there another way because my wget doesn't want to start. it just says starting the quits
2007-04-29T11:26:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	did you see the second thing I said about  Tools > Page Info  in firefox?
2007-04-29T11:27:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	yes I did.but wget is giving me errors when I try to start it.it doesn't even open
2007-04-29T11:27:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	but the second way doesn't require wget

2007-04-29T11:39:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	I don't use a proxy. I can't find curl
2007-04-29T11:40:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	sudo apt-get install curl
2007-04-29T11:40:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	and can you pastebin the output from wget?
2007-04-29T11:41:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	I found curl. wget doesn't give me any output
2007-04-29T11:41:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	how are you running it?
2007-04-29T11:43:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	I click on the gwet icon it says "starting" and then dies
2007-04-29T11:43:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	no, wget is a command you put in the terminal: wget http://www.ilogic.co.za/taxiwars.swf
2007-04-29T11:45:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	I was running Gwget. thanx

2007-04-29T11:47:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	Thanx a stack man
2007-05-08T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	do you receive any errors?
2007-05-08T15:33:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	no nothing
2007-05-08T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	how are you trying to copy?
2007-05-08T15:33:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	right click copy, then right click past
2007-05-08T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	try in a terminal
2007-05-08T15:36:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	how do I copy from the drive to a windows network drive
2007-05-08T15:37:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	is the windows network drive mounted somewhere?  you can just do 'cp from_location to_location'
2007-05-08T15:38:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	well I just clicked on places and network servers and took it from there. how do I do that in terminal
2007-05-08T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	I don't think those get mounted anywhere (or I don't know where).  This is using samba right?
2007-05-08T15:39:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	yes
2007-05-08T15:44:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	yes it is using smb
2007-05-08T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	instead of mounting it with the gui, use the mount command to mount in a directory somewhere and then try copying in a terminal
2007-05-08T15:45:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	thanx a stack
2007-05-08T15:46:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	1 last question. what command do I use to copy multiple directories
2007-05-08T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	cp -a dir1 dir2 ... dir_to_copy_to
2007-05-08T15:47:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	thanx
2007-05-08T15:55:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	I tried to mount the windows drive but it keeps telling me that there is no such file or directory, even though I can open it with the GUI
2007-05-08T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	did you create the mount point first?
2007-05-08T15:56:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	do you mean: mkdir /usbwindows ?
2007-05-08T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	yeah
2007-05-08T15:56:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	yes
2007-05-08T15:57:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	it cant find the windows mount point. but i see it in the gui
2007-05-08T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	hmm, maybe unmount it from the gui first (I don't use samba but I assume that is possible somehow)
2007-05-08T15:58:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	thanx
2007-05-09T16:05:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	sorry how do i copy multiple directries again
2007-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	cp -a dir1 dir2 ... dir_to_copy_to
2007-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	thanx
2007-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	what is the -a for
2007-05-09T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	cp won't copy directories by default
2007-05-09T16:07:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	i c
2007-05-09T16:14:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	how do I type into the terminal of the directory name is: J Download - Other (with the spaces) I want to copy from it
2007-05-09T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	well you can either let the shell worry about it and use tab completion, or escape the spaces yourself like this:  directory\ with\ spaces   or you can just surround it in quotation marks:  'directory with spaces'
2007-05-09T16:40:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	is there a way that I can temp. disable the auto mount for usb devices
2007-05-09T16:42:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	system > preferences > removable drives and media
2007-05-09T16:42:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	thanx
2007-05-09T16:57:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	Sorry to bother again. copying over the network is just taking too long. I have put the drive in my machine. it is a IDE drive (the 3rd) how do I know what to mount it as (hda, hdc etc)
2007-05-09T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	sudo fdisk -l     should list them all, and 'mount' should tell you which ones are already mounted so you can narrow it down that way
2007-05-09T05:01:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	when I run this command I get this output (i already have a ntfs drive mounted this way) sudo ntfs-3g /dev/hdc1 /media/Jacques
2007-05-09T05:01:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	sorry
2007-05-09T05:02:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	do you want me to past it into pastbin for you
2007-05-09T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	I haven't seen that before, but just read over the options and choose the one that is easiest for you
2007-05-09T05:03:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	it gives me this on the linux machine. this is what is weire
2007-05-09T05:04:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	how do I unmount
2007-05-09T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	umount /dev/foobar
2007-05-09T05:04:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	 thanx
2007-05-09T05:28:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	sorry, how do i check if hda, hdb etc. my window closed and i lost the command
2007-05-09T05:29:00.000Z	jrib	Cyrus25801	sudo fdisk -l     should list them all, and 'mount' should tell you which ones are already mounted so you can narrow it down that way
2007-05-09T05:29:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	thanx
2007-05-18T11:48:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	jrib	hey, hope you doing well
