2011-10-23T01:01:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	seems like a multiple sound conflicted issue there. can you at least reach to The GRUB Menu !
2011-10-23T01:01:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	I can reach the install-to-hdd/memcheck/livecd menu, if that was what you meant
2011-10-23T01:04:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Yes .. press "e" there and type this  .. acpi=off .. after quiet splash .. as a boot option then press Ctrl+X to boot , when you reach the Desktop make sure you sudo update and upgrade the system.
2011-10-23T01:06:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	nothing happens when I press "e"
2011-10-23T01:07:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	no menu shows up!

2011-10-23T01:17:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	am a bit lost there .. Back tot he GRUB Menu .. what do you see if you press Advanced options and / help
2011-10-23T01:18:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	advanced options only shows "back...". Help shows some f-keys, then after a few seconds it shows a lot of text, and goes into the ubuntu 11.10 splashscreen
2011-10-23T01:19:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	 yes help ,  is there F6 Key as an option !
2011-10-23T01:19:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	after the splash screen it shows a lot of text again, and then gives me a cmd line. It tells me "to run a command as administrator, use sudo command", see "man sudo_root" for details
2011-10-23T01:19:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	should I go check that out first, or stay in this cmd line?

2011-10-23T01:24:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	it outputs a lot of text, it hangs at "ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log" for a few seconds, then: xinit: giving up, xinit: unable to connect to X server: Connection refused, xinit: server error. Then it gives me back the cmd line
2011-10-23T01:27:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	okay , thats graphic card driver issue .. go back to the GRUB Menu o try some boot option .. but while you on that screen check what graphic card you have " sudo lshw -C Video "  Nvidia , or  ..
2011-10-23T01:28:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	it says: PCI (sysfs)

2011-10-23T01:30:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	for your knowledge, I have before tried to install the graphics card on this device when I was running 11.04. It made the system not boot anymore. I couldn't get the right resolution before I attempted that though.
2011-10-23T01:30:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	Intel GMA 500 integrated graphics card
2011-10-23T01:31:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	okay , thats an onboard one ..
2011-10-23T01:32:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	yes. It's a netbook. I think it only has an onboard one.
2011-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Yeah , so now i got the boot option that might pass you to the Desktop .. all you you need now is to paste that option to boot.
2011-10-23T01:35:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	should I reboot and go back to the option menu?
2011-10-23T01:35:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Press Ctrl+Alt+BAckspace to reboot .. when you see the GRUB Menu press "e"
2011-10-23T01:35:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Yes.
2011-10-23T01:35:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	ctrl alt backspace does not make it reboot.
2011-10-23T01:36:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	I'll just use the power button to reboot
2011-10-23T01:37:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	pressing "e" does not do anything.
2011-10-23T01:38:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	I can "Press ENTER to boot or TAB to edit a menu entry"
2011-10-23T01:38:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Okay , Tab then ..
2011-10-23T01:38:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	do you see the kernel Menu !

2011-10-23T01:46:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	okay , replace -- with i915.modeset=1 .. then press ESc should take you back to the first menu try Run Ubuntu from USB
2011-10-23T01:48:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	this takes me to the same screen I showed you a picture of. I'm at ubuntu@ubuntu:~$

2011-10-23T01:56:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	and if you replaced acpi=force with =off ..
2011-10-23T01:57:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	you mean replace acpi=off with =force?
2011-10-23T01:57:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	also try =1 on that modeset .
2011-10-23T01:57:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	im trying =1 and =off now, that gives me a light grey screen
2011-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Yes , acpi=force ..
2011-10-23T01:58:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	nice step ..

2011-10-23T02:18:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Yeah i bet ..
2011-10-23T02:20:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	you got to that login screen after which menu ! is that the broken 11.10 .
2011-10-23T02:20:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	I don't understand what you just asked
2011-10-23T02:21:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	the tty login screen with no X with your Ubuntu user-name ..
2011-10-23T02:22:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	I did not get to a login screen when I just booted 10.04 from the USB, it takes me straight to the desktop
2011-10-23T02:23:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	Oh okay , so that tty screen with no X was the broken 11.10 .
2011-10-23T02:23:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	I think so
2011-10-23T02:24:00.000Z	s1	Masxmasx	is that system monted and shown in your 10.04 .
2011-10-23T02:25:00.000Z	Masxmasx	s1	yes.
