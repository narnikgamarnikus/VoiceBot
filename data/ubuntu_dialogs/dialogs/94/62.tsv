2007-12-09T16:21:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 sorry give me a min
2007-12-09T15:51:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	you could make a simple script and mark executable + put it in libraries
2007-12-09T15:53:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	it's just that i'm not so familiar with linux yet... that's why i'm askig if there is already anoption
2007-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	if you attach " && rm file.rar" to the end of your command it'll remove it anyway if unrar completes successfully
2007-12-09T15:55:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	that's why I suggested a script something like "#!/bin/bash<newline>unrar -options $1 && rm $1"
2007-12-09T15:56:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	the thing is that i have rar files in parts... when i unrar file1.part1.rar  it automatically goes to the next part ..
2007-12-09T15:58:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	well, If I were you I'd make a couple of dummy parted rar files and play around with a script until you get something that works
2007-12-09T15:59:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	for scripting, I found this a great place to start: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html - you won't need anything too complicated anyway
2007-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	tnx a lot :D i'm goint to check it out now!
2007-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	np, hopefully you get a solution easily enough ^^
2007-12-09T16:05:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	$1 is the first argument, e.g if you typed scriptname -x, $1=-x
2007-12-09T16:07:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	yes i know $1 :) (one of the little things i do know..) the thing is how I will be able to check if unrar was successful..
2007-12-09T16:08:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	&& should mean "only do the next statement if the previous was successful" although someone correct me very fast if I'm wrong here
2007-12-09T16:09:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 i hope you are not cause i'm gonna try do this script really soon :P
2007-12-09T16:09:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	for the love of love, test it first x_x
2007-12-09T16:10:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	i will :)
2007-12-09T16:16:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	did you get it to work?
2007-12-09T16:45:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 i almost did it... only that if doesn't work.. yet
2007-12-09T16:47:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	what's not working?
2007-12-09T16:48:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm working on a simple version for fun :P
2007-12-09T16:50:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	o_o lol
2007-12-09T16:51:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	don't laugh.. i'm just getting started using linux and writing scripts and all of that :)
2007-12-09T16:52:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm pretty new myself actually - I don't know how I make so many mistakes -_-;; I just thought it would be a good way to solve your problem
2007-12-09T16:56:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	plus && works just fine.. (if and only first command was excecuted successfully...) and the script works :D
2007-12-09T16:56:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	cool, can I see?
2007-12-09T17:01:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47522/
2007-12-09T17:04:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	now... i just need to make it work for multiple inputs..
2007-12-09T17:04:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	have an overcomplicated one
2007-12-09T17:04:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47523/
2007-12-09T17:05:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	run away? hahaha
2007-12-09T17:08:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	did you get that?
2007-12-09T17:09:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 no what ?
2007-12-09T17:10:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	PM
2007-12-09T17:12:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	i said ur script is a little long :p
2007-12-09T17:13:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	:P
2007-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm putting the whole thing in a for loop to try get you multiple input files
2007-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 and i guess works better with people who are not familiar with the script... i mean i know what i wrote in MY script and what input i have to give..
2007-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 yeah that would be my next step as well :))
2007-12-09T17:14:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	oh, ok, sure
2007-12-09T17:15:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	in that case, these may help: $# counts no. arguments, and you can use "for i in `seq 1 $#`" to iterate the number of times that there are arguments
2007-12-09T17:16:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	alternately, you can do everything on the $1 argument, "shift" every time you're finished and reiterate until $# = 0
2007-12-09T17:16:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	there are probably other ways, but yep
2007-12-09T17:17:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	yeah.. thanks :)) i'm gonna try it.. if you do it too i'd like to see :)
2007-12-09T17:17:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	alright, I'll see if this works or not ^^"
2007-12-09T17:17:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	heh ok :))
2007-12-09T17:29:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I have something that seems to work
2007-12-09T17:29:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	although I've only tried it for the scenario where the filenames are correct
2007-12-09T17:30:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	i need to try a couple of things... if you want show me urs
2007-12-09T17:30:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47526/
2007-12-09T17:46:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	how's it coming?
2007-12-09T17:47:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	wait.. the only rar files i have to test it appear to be broken
2007-12-09T17:48:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	sure :)
2007-12-09T18:05:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	i have a question.. in line 10 you have a test.. if ...... =0.   then if op=yes you have another test, if ... =1.     but from line 10 it only enters if as long as ... =0.   (or maybe i haven't understood everything :/ )
2007-12-09T18:07:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	line 10 checks if there is a .rar extension - grep counts the lines with .rar present. if it's not present, it warns you that it's probably not going to work because it's probably the wrong filetype
2007-12-09T18:07:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	if .rar isn't present, it then prompts you for whether you want to try unrar it anyway
2007-12-09T18:08:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	the second choice with opt checks if it's a parted or normal rar file and handles the deletion of files accordingly
2007-12-09T18:09:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	if the file DOES have .rar in the filename, it just does the normal stuff
2007-12-09T18:09:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I might add an extra echo to clarify what file it's working on at present actually - I'll edit that pastebin thing
2007-12-09T18:10:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	ok good :))
2007-12-09T18:12:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	apparently the pastebin thinks I'm a spammer now and hates me :( oh well, if you change the "file does not appear to be a rar file" to "$FILE does not appear to be a rar file" it'll be easier to use ^_^"
2007-12-09T18:13:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	hahaha :P
2007-12-09T18:14:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	there we go http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47531/ >___> I had to make a new one. anyway, I'm going to sleep because it's 2:15am here.. enjoy your scripting!
2007-12-09T18:14:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	!!! where are u from ?
2007-12-09T18:15:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	new zealand - it's somewhere near the big landmass called australia ^_~
2007-12-09T18:15:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	heh :)) nice nice
2007-12-10T08:48:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	hahahah can't do that you know... I've hurt my leg.. a week now.. can't walk.. she needs to come :P I've got, shopping, housework.... many many things need to be done :P
2007-12-10T08:49:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	that's terrible :( in that case, welcome your enslaved mother with open arms, haha. I hope it's not too severe
2007-12-10T08:50:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	heh.. yeaaaaah... and the thing is that i have a list of things i need from the supermarket... so I have to be nice to her, so that she goes and get it all!!
2007-12-10T08:51:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm sure she will ^^ I need to go out and be active myself soon D:
2007-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	I am NOT so sure :P It will still be a miracle actually if she comes... she never does... and I live only 1.5 hour away...
2007-12-10T08:53:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	...I don't know what to say :(
2007-12-10T08:53:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	well don't thing there is anything to say :/    do you live alone or with your parents ?
2007-12-10T08:54:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm with my mother for the next year, then moving out (!)
2007-12-10T08:55:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	nice :)  you are going away to study ?
2007-12-10T08:56:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	don't want to spend all of uni at home :P I've planned for flatting with some friends so yeah - they all want to wait until second year though so I will too
2007-12-10T08:57:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm on the *have finished school but haven't started uni* time - this is our summer so summer holidays
2007-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	i see :) and how old are u ?
2007-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	17.. my birthday is the day before first semester starts lol
2007-12-10T08:59:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	hmm you are done with school earlier than we do... here in greece we finish school at 18, hopefully go to uni... I am in 3rd year now... (20 years old)
2007-12-10T09:00:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I'm fairly young for my year.. What are you studying?
2007-12-10T09:00:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	oh i c... informatics and comminications
2007-12-10T09:00:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	what are you gonna study ?
2007-12-10T09:00:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	hopefully mechatronics engineering
2007-12-10T09:01:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	you don't know yet? you haven't decided ?
2007-12-10T09:01:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	first year is general for us: we don't specialize until second, unless you get into an accelerated course
2007-12-10T09:02:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	haha - have you heard of NCEA? we don't get numerical marks in school :D
2007-12-10T09:03:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	when we finish school we have exams... the grade of these exams define in which universtity and which field we are gonna study..
2007-12-10T09:03:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	NCEA? no... tell me about it
2007-12-10T09:04:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	you achieve a standard by passing it, and then higher levels of work get "achievement with merit" or "achievement with excellence"
2007-12-10T09:04:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	 i see :)
2007-12-10T09:04:00.000Z	differentreality	drafael	does this system work good with students ?
2007-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	well, it's really, really easy haha - there's heaps and heaps of criticism
2007-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I find it fairly impossible to fail
2007-12-10T09:06:00.000Z	drafael	differentreality	I imagine D: I like my way
