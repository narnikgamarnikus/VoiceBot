2007-03-07T06:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	mms is the secure multimedia protocol. It's to let you watch videos without you saving them.
2007-03-07T06:39:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	it still can't play WMV9 I think...
2007-03-07T06:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Sure it can, with w32codecs.
2007-03-07T06:39:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I already got the win32 codecs and all, but it says it "can't parse that"
2007-03-07T06:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	What media player?
2007-03-07T06:40:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	well, the one that opens embedded in the firefox browser
2007-03-07T06:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	That was useful. Please go to about:plugins and pastebin the whole page.

2007-03-07T06:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Totem. Lots of people have had trouble with that. Feel like trying mplayer?
2007-03-07T06:42:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I can try
2007-03-07T06:43:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	should I just install mplayer and that's it?
2007-03-07T06:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Okay... apt-get install mozilla-mplayer totem-mozilla-
2007-03-07T06:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	That's a command, and yes the - at the end is intentional.
2007-03-07T06:44:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	do I have to restart?
2007-03-07T06:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Firefox yes, computer no.
2007-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	and if I want to revert it to Totem?
2007-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Then check into a mental hospital.
2007-03-07T06:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	apt-get install mozilla-mplayer- totem-mozilla
2007-03-07T06:51:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	yep, it's working now
2007-03-07T06:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	yw.
2007-03-07T06:52:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	still, I think when I installed the win32 codecs I didn't restart Firefox
2007-03-07T06:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	That doesn't matter.
2007-03-07T06:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	w32codecs are for the media player. Firefox doesn't know or care about them. You had to restart firefox when you changed the firefox plugins.
2007-03-07T06:53:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	hmm.. now video is showing wrong :P
2007-03-07T06:53:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	(green mostly) as if it had missed some frames
2007-03-07T06:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Right-click on the movie, go to preferences, change the video output to x11, audio to alsa, and check "connect to rtsp media over tcp"
2007-03-07T06:54:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Refresh the page.
2007-03-07T06:55:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I think it's working a bit better... tho' still there's no good sound
2007-03-07T06:56:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	what are the settings for your cache?

2007-03-07T07:00:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	do you know how to set my default browser back to Firefox?
2007-03-07T07:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Nope. Don't run gnome. What is it now?
2007-03-07T07:01:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	it was firefox, but for some reason it just changed to galeon
2007-03-07T07:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	No. That has nothing to do with it whatsoever.
2007-03-07T07:02:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	that's what I thought... but now it's opening galeon and I did nothing :(
2007-03-07T07:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Ask if someone can help you change your default browser.
2007-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	(k)ubuntu felt really slow for me too when I used it...
2007-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	what are you using now?
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Debian. It owns my soul.
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I still haven't figured how to install debian in my FakeRAID :(
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	it doesn't either have dmraid, and I don't know how to load it from the installation
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Quick google: I bought a couple of 120GB SATA drives on Friday, and I thought why not use the nVidia FakeRAID on my mobo. Turns out that only Gentoo and Fedora 5 have support for FakeRAID on the install media itself.
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Hence I had to go looking for details on installing Debian/Ubuntu on FakeRAID. Turns out that while dmraid (the software that provides support for FakeRAID has not been integrated with the installer, but is in the repositories, and it is possible to get an installation up and running somehow.
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	http://people.ubuntu-in.org/~soumyadip/blog/index.php?/archives/25-The-case-for-FakeRAID-support-in-Linux-installers.html (if it helps)
2007-03-22T09:34:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	and FreeBSD ;)
2007-03-22T09:34:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	will it be the same as in Ubuntu?
2007-03-22T09:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Pft, freeBSD. No one without buttons who is capable of serving webpages runs freeBSD.
2007-03-22T09:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Dunno. Debian and ubuntu are so close that I help out in this channel all the time without any problems, I just have to double-check the packages in packages.ubuntu.com, but it's almost always the same.
2007-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I wonder why Ubuntu is slower tho'
2007-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	*shrug* some misconfiguration somewhere? I don't know...
2007-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	I guess I'm just used to the debian-installer... I love it. It's so straightforward. The LiveCD never starts for me anyway. Not on two of my four machines, anyway.
2007-03-22T09:38:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	if it wasn't for the slow start of my apps I'd stay with Ubuntu (but you really can tell it's slower, honestly... it's a noticeable difference)
2007-03-22T09:41:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	can you download modules during the debian installation?
2007-03-22T09:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Dunno... never needed to. I know it asks you what modules to load if you use the "expert" option, but I have no idea how extensive that is and have never used it.
2007-03-22T09:42:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I did that of what the Ubuntu article explains about FakeRAID but in debian I don't know how to do it, 'cause it's not a live system on which you can get dmraid and load it
2007-03-22T09:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Actually, you could always alt-f# over to a terminal and install the package manually... that's definitely possible.
2007-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	but how :S
2007-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	using apt-get ?
2007-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Yes... you'd probably need to chroot to /target.
2007-03-22T09:45:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	what about repositories and stuff, could you please help me find the dmraid 1.0.0 rc13 ?
2007-03-22T09:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	It's in the main repositories. http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all&keywords=dmraid&sourceid=mozilla-search
2007-03-22T09:46:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	so it should work if I just issue apt-get in the terminal then?
2007-03-22T09:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	I don't recall how complicated it is... how good are you with apt?
2007-03-22T09:47:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	and what's that about udeb (debian installer vs admin) ?
2007-03-22T09:47:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I'm rather new :S
2007-03-22T09:47:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	but I'm a fast learner
2007-03-22T09:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Oh... you probably shouldn't do this then. It can get mighty confusing if you don't have your head securely wrapped around chroots.
2007-03-22T09:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	udeb packages are for inclusion in the debian-installer. Its existence makes me think dmraid might already be integrated, maybe in the nightly snapshots?
2007-03-22T09:48:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	is there a way to verify if it has?
2007-03-22T09:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	I really don't know anything about this issue... sorry.
2007-03-22T09:49:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I got the one at http://www.us.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
2007-03-22T09:54:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	so technically to make it work, I should basically do: during installation, change to a shell, do chroot /target, install the dmraid package using apt-get install dmraid; load the module using modprobe dmraid, and that's it?
2007-03-22T09:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Again, I don't know anything about software raid and very little about installing debian. That was a suggestion for something that you might be able to get away with.
2007-03-22T09:55:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I understand, but did that sound like something logical and that could work?
2007-03-22T09:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Yes.
2007-03-22T09:56:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	ok I'll try it and then I'll let you know :)
2007-03-22T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Hold on
2007-03-22T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	That won't work.
2007-03-22T09:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	If you have to chroot to target to install stuff into it, then the root partition has to already exist and a basic system be installed.
2007-03-22T09:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Er, yeah. Sorry. xD
2007-03-22T09:57:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	so, maybe I'll use a ram disk then
2007-03-22T09:59:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I suppose it doesn't really matter where a kernel module is located at when I load it, right?
2007-03-22T09:59:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	so I could just download it to a ram disk and modprobe it from there... I hope?
2007-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	I really don't know anything about this issue and shouldn't be answering your questions because I'll mislead you. Sorry.
2007-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	okay, thanks anyway :)
2007-03-22T10:02:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	I found dmraid in my Debian disk
2007-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	Cool!
2007-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	By default?
2007-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	well, it's there in the iso... but I don't know how to load it :S
2007-03-22T10:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	It won't load itself? What if you boot in expert mode?
2007-03-22T10:05:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	but dmraid is at /pool/main/d/dmraid in my Debian netinst disk
2007-03-22T10:06:00.000Z	Kronuz	arrenlex	do you think expert mode loads more drivers by itself?
2007-03-22T10:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kronuz	No, but it gives you options for what modules to load.
