2007-07-27T13:22:00.000Z	rafaelscj		I am on Ubuntu live now, and my mouse ps/2 don't work, Help me
2007-07-27T13:22:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	this has to be configured with /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-07-27T13:27:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I just sent you my xorg.conf. In this file, look for "Congfigured Mouse"
2007-07-27T13:28:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	...
2007-07-27T13:29:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I how can access the meny by keuboard?
2007-07-27T13:29:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	oh, thats a good question ...
2007-07-27T13:29:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	Ctrl+F2?
2007-07-27T13:30:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	no, this does not work ..
2007-07-27T13:30:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I suggest you look into the help programme (either for Gnome or KDE, look for shortcuts)
2007-07-27T13:30:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I will try
2007-07-27T13:35:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I will conect my usb mouse
2007-07-27T13:45:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I am new to ubuntu, I am using Kubuntu, and there is no programme "gedit" in here.
2007-07-27T13:40:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	maybe you should look at http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=24421333
2007-07-27T13:41:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I openned the dialog "run command" by pressing alt+f2
2007-07-27T13:43:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I now: gedit /etc/X11/Xorg.conf
2007-07-27T13:44:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I think you are right. Look for a line containing "ps"
2007-07-27T13:45:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	because you're usink kde
2007-07-27T13:46:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	kate, thats fine, but how do you edit this file without a mouse?
2007-07-27T13:47:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I thing that i can edit it without mouse
2007-07-27T13:48:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	OK, so look for a section in this file which defines your mouse settings. Look for "mouse" in this file, do you have it?
2007-07-27T13:49:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	protocol is ImPS/2
2007-07-27T13:50:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	Ok, thats fine then. Just a moment ...
2007-07-27T13:51:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	do you have such elements in the section, which contains "mouse"?
2007-07-27T13:52:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	no, I haven't
2007-07-27T13:52:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	the section's name is imputdevice
2007-07-27T13:53:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	maybe then you should insert this section into your xorg.conf file. I sent you my xorg.conf, did you receive it?
2007-07-27T13:53:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	no, i didn't
2007-07-27T13:53:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	yes, that is correct. but there are several of these sections!
2007-07-27T13:54:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	correct
2007-07-27T13:54:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	may i rename it?
2007-07-27T13:54:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	hm, I thought that file transfer works with IRC?
2007-07-27T13:54:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	yes
2007-07-27T13:55:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I will send you this file again ...
2007-07-27T13:55:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	did you get my xorg.conf?
2007-07-27T13:55:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	no
2007-07-27T13:56:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	sh*t ;)
2007-07-27T13:57:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	can you use my FTP server to upload it?
2007-07-27T13:58:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I think I can do that.
2007-07-27T13:58:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I now see a progress bar - my file is currently sent to you!
2007-07-27T13:58:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	please wait moment...
2007-07-27T13:59:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	no, it does not work ("time out")
2007-07-27T14:01:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	but when using ftp, I need to know your PW. But I do not want to know your PW. Or set it back then, afterwards.
2007-07-27T14:01:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	Now you can access my ftp server on rafaelscj.no-ip.org
2007-07-27T14:01:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	OK
2007-07-27T14:02:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	"An error occurred while loading http://rafaelscj.no-ip.org:"
2007-07-27T14:03:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	oh, sorry ..
2007-07-27T14:03:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	the user is "upload"

2007-07-27T14:07:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	now the prompt, after ftp <your domain> does nothing ...
2007-07-27T14:08:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	still blank prompt ...
2007-07-27T14:09:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	argh
2007-07-27T14:09:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I too have a web site, but I do not have the user credentials here in this ubuntu installation for uploading my file ...
2007-07-27T14:09:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	I know the problem, please wait
2007-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	Now it will work
2007-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I have a prompt asking me for a PW!
2007-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	password is blank
2007-07-27T14:13:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	"Login failed"

2007-07-27T14:22:00.000Z	rafaelscj	jrad_	should I change the protocol to PS/2 or the Device to /dev/mouse?
2007-07-27T14:23:00.000Z	jrad_	rafaelscj	I know some details about Xorg, but not all ...
