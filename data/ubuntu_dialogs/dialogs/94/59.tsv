2010-10-30T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	will you please use the pastebin, you have flooded repeatedly and scrolling the channel is not helpful nor fair to other users
2010-10-30T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	if you obey the floodbot instead of scrolling the channel to death then you won't have a problem
2010-10-30T09:45:00.000Z	randal	ActionParsnip	sorry ill use pastbin for now on
2010-10-30T09:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	cool :)

2010-10-30T09:52:00.000Z	randal	ActionParsnip	 how do you ping
2010-10-30T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	same as in any OS you can name
2010-10-30T09:52:00.000Z	randal	ActionParsnip	 i dont know how
2010-10-30T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	open a terminal with CTRL+ALT+T then type: ping 8.8.8.8 -c 4   and hit enter
2010-10-30T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	you never did a ping in windows before?
2010-10-30T09:55:00.000Z	randal	ActionParsnip	 i typed that in put it did not ping it it just gave me options
2010-10-30T09:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	ok try: ping 8.8.8.8    instead
2010-10-30T09:56:00.000Z	randal	ActionParsnip	 it pinged fine i think sent 4 recieved 4
2010-10-30T09:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randal	sounds like your DNS sucks then. If you run: gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf    delete ALL text and add this line:  nameserver 8.8.8.8   save the new file, close gedit and all browsers then retry the browser, see if it flys
