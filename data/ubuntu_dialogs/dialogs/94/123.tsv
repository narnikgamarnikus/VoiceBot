2004-11-22T06:14:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	what else did you compile??
2004-11-22T06:16:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	you dont need to compile anything in ubuntu.....if it doesnt work its a bug.... report it  and it will be fixed
2004-11-22T06:20:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	look in /usr/local...there should be noting in /lib or /bin ....
2004-11-22T06:25:00.000Z	Drago	ogra	still doesn't change the fact that xsane doesn't find my scanner.
2004-11-22T06:31:00.000Z	Drago	ogra	anyclue what else may be causing it?
2004-11-22T06:34:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	could you try again: sudo xsane
2004-11-22T06:36:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	ARGH.....

2004-11-22T06:36:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	its from universe and its not needed...
2004-11-22T06:37:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3306
2004-11-22T06:37:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	seems related

2004-11-22T06:41:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	please try the bootoptions mentioned there
2004-11-22T06:51:00.000Z	Drago	ogra	none of those options would let me boot
2004-11-22T06:52:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	a boot with each of them ?
2004-11-22T06:54:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	how did you add the options?
2004-11-22T06:55:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	in edit mode at the end of the kernel line

2004-11-22T07:10:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	so i'm really at the end now......if neither of them help, please file a bug, i dont know what else your friend did to your system....so i have no idea how to help
2004-11-22T07:12:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	i dont know if he changed _any_ config ....created devices and so on ...... we could run this task for ages and wouldnt come to an end
2004-11-22T07:13:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	make sure your system is in a state as it was after install, then file a bug please
2004-11-24T15:51:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	lsmod|grep s
2004-11-24T15:52:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	leave grep s, doesnt filter too much *g*
2004-11-24T15:56:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	sudo modprobe sg
2004-11-24T15:57:00.000Z	ogra	Drago	echo sg | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2004-11-24T15:58:00.000Z	Drago	ogra	that was it my scanner works now. needed the sg module loaded.
