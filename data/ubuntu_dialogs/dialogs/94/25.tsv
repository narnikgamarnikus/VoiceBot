2009-11-11T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	copy the libflashplugin.so to the chromium plugins folder then edit the chromium menu item to add --enable-plugins to the end of the command
2009-11-11T17:44:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	I just get lines where the Flash window should go
2009-11-11T17:45:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	Now plugins are enableb by default
2009-11-11T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	http://pastebin.com/m739ac875
2009-11-11T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i have 64bit flash and 64bit java in chromium
2009-11-11T17:46:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	You are from Oslo?

2009-11-12T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	hardly disaster, its a text file, the comment can be uncommented
2009-11-12T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i'm sure other servers have them some place
2009-11-12T19:25:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	seems inefficient
2009-11-12T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	what does?
2009-11-12T19:25:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	It could be done in paralell
2009-11-12T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i find it risky due to processes accessing the disk
2009-11-12T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	can you advise boscop
2009-11-12T19:26:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	lock the files!
2009-11-12T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	sorry, crossed wires
2009-11-12T19:43:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	tried that and it didn't work
2009-11-17T19:50:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	I wish it was that simple, I really do
2009-11-23T19:24:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	you need .gvfs  to automount external partitions..
2009-11-23T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i know but the guy has a backup
2009-11-23T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	as s/he is smart
2009-11-23T19:25:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	thank god..
2009-11-23T19:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i would re-permission the folder but a restore has been chosen by the user
2009-11-23T19:28:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	the problem it that it is that the files are locked while ubuntu is running
2009-11-23T19:29:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	or at least that is my guess
2009-11-23T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	gotcha
2009-11-23T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	makes sense
2009-11-23T19:53:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	the .deb file from their site works
2009-11-23T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i know, i use it
2009-11-23T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	no crappy firefox for me
2009-11-23T19:55:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	I use chrome these days
2009-11-23T19:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i kinda bounce between but mainly chromium here
2009-11-24T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	or grep the output to make it intelligible
2009-11-24T15:50:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	right -exec grep "regexp" {} \;
2009-11-24T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i use find personally but yeah, same kinda jazz
2009-11-24T15:52:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	lol
2009-11-24T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	?
2009-11-24T15:54:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	well -exec was a option to find
2009-11-24T15:54:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	read a bit further up
2009-11-24T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	sudo find / -iname *.so" | grep flash
2009-11-24T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	for example
2009-11-24T15:54:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	you don't need sudo
2009-11-24T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	it reduces the "access denied" messages for a cleaner output, so I use it
2009-11-24T15:55:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	and that can be wtitten find / -iname '*.so' -exec grep flash {} \;
2009-11-24T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	try it, you'll see what i mean
2009-11-24T15:56:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	Yes I get them, but I never cared. They were never in interesting direcories anyhow
2009-11-24T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	indeed, mines just a bit neater as you dont have to end the line or use braces etc
2009-11-24T15:57:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	I , of cource, prefer mine :)
2009-11-24T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	tats fine
2009-11-24T16:00:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	in this case you win, but say you wanna 'rm'.. let alone sun a bach file on it.
2009-11-24T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	its not about winning
2009-11-24T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	why is it some sort of competition?
2009-11-24T16:01:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	no, just a disgression
2009-11-24T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	true but the subject has sailed, yes exec will let you execute stuff on the results but if you just want to list the files, both are equal
2009-11-24T16:02:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	right, that's what I ment
2009-11-24T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	i understood too
2009-11-25T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	put sudo in front of the command, the password is the one you log in with
2009-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	and sound stuff too
2009-11-25T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	ubuntu uses gstreamer, kubuntu uses something else, hence the restricted-extras package being different
2009-11-25T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	imagemagick is amazing :)
2009-11-25T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	as is mogrify
2009-11-25T18:20:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	that is no true, ubuntu can access exfat
2009-11-25T18:21:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	since today actually, see the new kernel update
2009-11-25T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	well flaps is having issues, please advise him/her
2009-11-26T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	its all the same to me
2010-03-03T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	install and its away, just change the port and you are golden :)
2010-03-03T17:56:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	pointless
2010-03-03T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	very pointless
2010-03-03T17:57:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	I don't use the, either
2011-10-15T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	sudo passwd -dl guest

2011-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	well be educated :)
2011-11-10T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	it won't go in any of my systems, nor do I intend to spend that on a video card
2011-11-10T16:40:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	one sinister power plug.
2011-11-10T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	how is a power plug sinister?
2011-11-10T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	great, still not buying it myself

2011-11-10T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	I'm on a single core amd sempron 1.6Ghz with onboard nvidia 6150LE
2011-11-10T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	maybe but the price difference is significant
2011-11-10T18:00:00.000Z	Younder	ActionParsnip	perhaps
2011-11-10T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	sup?
2011-11-10T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Younder	not constructive
