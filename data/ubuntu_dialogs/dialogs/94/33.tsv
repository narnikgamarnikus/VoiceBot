2009-06-04T03:20:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	im back
2009-06-04T03:21:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	under places it shows three partitions (one is my windows on)
2009-06-04T03:23:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	i just mnted them
2009-06-04T03:23:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	where did you mount them to?
2009-06-04T03:24:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	as /media/sda1 and /media/sda5?
2009-06-04T03:28:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	did you do that and does it now give you a # prompt?
2009-06-04T03:28:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	yes
2009-06-04T03:29:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	 ok type cd /dev/disk/by-uuid
2009-06-04T03:29:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	ok
2009-06-04T03:41:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	i really confused the whole drive i guess
2009-06-04T03:29:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	no scratch that its already in your fstab, type cd /media/disk
2009-06-04T03:30:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	k
2009-06-04T03:31:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	one last check type ls and see if there are a bunch of directories, then type ls /media/disk-1 and see if its empty
2009-06-04T03:33:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	no they both have things in them
2009-06-04T03:33:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	type df -k and pastebin it please
2009-06-04T03:33:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	look at this : http://paste.ubuntu.com/187715/
2009-06-04T03:34:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	result df -k : http://paste.ubuntu.com/187716/
2009-06-04T03:34:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	ok one is your / directory the other /boot
2009-06-04T03:35:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	the smaller one is / ie disk-1
2009-06-04T03:36:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	I see that you have a seperate directory for that boot directory, what was the partition you had before?
2009-06-04T03:36:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	i think /root
2009-06-04T03:37:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	cat /media/disk/etc/fstab and pastebin that please
2009-06-04T03:40:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	i have the fstab from /disk-1 here (not /disk) : http://paste.ubuntu.com/187717/
2009-06-04T03:40:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	sda6 is your /boot parition and about 400000000 of 478276116 too big
2009-06-04T03:41:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	of I see what you did you acutally dont even use /dev/sda6, even if there are files there.  Do you still want a separate partition to keep your kernel files?
2009-06-04T03:42:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	what you did was to take some space, unfortunatly about 90% of it, and give it to something that needs very little space.  Further you took it from something that needs more
2009-06-04T03:42:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	yes
2009-06-04T03:43:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	it came from not ralizing the correct mount points during install if you are curious how that happened
2009-06-04T03:43:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	can I convince you to do otherwise? leave the /boot with the / and make that new partition your home?
2009-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	will i be able to upgrade? i can just wipe out / when the time comes? if it comes?
2009-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	and yes i do want the new partiton to be my home
2009-06-04T03:44:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	yu can do that now, but what I am suggesting will make that easier
2009-06-04T03:45:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	right... i gotcha. it will be easier moving forward
2009-06-04T03:45:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	i would like to do that yes
2009-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	i have a copy of the grub kernel on BOTH partitions as of now
2009-06-04T03:48:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	the grub kernel is on the fist secor of the disk, that are just its files and confuration.  A assumed it was on both but wanted to be sure.  Becase the first thing we need to do is clean out /media/disk-1 but before you do make sure you dont need them
2009-06-04T03:49:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	media/disk-1 is the smaller partition
2009-06-04T03:50:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	thats where i want to boot off of correct? so that has the grub files in the folder "boot"
2009-06-04T03:50:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	yes I was wrong pastebin /media/disk-1/boot/grub/menu.list please
2009-06-04T03:53:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	that file doesnt exist
2009-06-04T03:53:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	so you really are using that big partition as your boot parition?
2009-06-04T03:54:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	what i had started to do with the other fellow was switch to making the smaller one the boot but i guess we didnt suceed
2009-06-04T03:54:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	more like your did it backwards :)  ok cd /media/disk and type mkdir /boot
2009-06-04T03:55:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	sorry no its already there, what is in /dev/disk-1/boot
2009-06-04T03:57:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	here is ls /media/disk-1/boot: http://paste.ubuntu.com/187732/
2009-06-04T04:03:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	u want the content of those files? here: this is from the larger (/media/disk) http://paste.ubuntu.com/187736/
2009-06-04T04:03:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	Im only cheking so we dont screw up the system
2009-06-04T04:04:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	screw up the system any worse you mean
2009-06-04T04:05:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	what does the one in /media/disk-1 say?
2009-06-04T04:06:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	http://paste.ubuntu.com/187738/
2009-06-04T04:06:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	but i think that its bec of the livecd maybe that it looks like that?
2009-06-04T04:07:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	they are both the same, are you sure you got the right ones? the one on /media/disk-1 should have /boot before each kernel line
2009-06-04T04:08:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	no forget that. but they do seem to be identical
2009-06-04T04:08:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	im sure. but maybe bec im livecd?
2009-06-04T04:09:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	so bec i booted off the cd the file is diff? ist that possible?
2009-06-04T04:09:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	no, I think you edited one before you copied it to the new partition and now only one is correct.  type fdisk -l and tell me what partition is marked as *
2009-06-04T04:10:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	would u believe the windows partiton?
2009-06-04T04:11:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	but it must be the disk-1 that it botts off of bec for the psat month it was the only thing mounted and ubuntu started
2009-06-04T04:12:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	yes and it does not really matter, go edit the /media/disk-1/grub/menu.lst and add /boot in front of every kernel and initrd line
2009-06-04T04:19:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	doin it. says it may take a while
2009-06-04T04:19:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	shouldt take that long, not nearly as long as the next thing your going to do
2009-06-04T04:20:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	was this the correct syntax: sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/disk /dev/sda
2009-06-04T04:21:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	it says =: unexpected operator
2009-06-04T04:24:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	do you have any other disks on this, and is this hardy or lenny?
2009-06-04T04:26:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	this is 9.04
2009-06-04T04:26:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	try changing /dev/sda to hd0
2009-06-04T04:27:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	it finished... it says: Installing GRUB to /dev/sda as (hd0)...Installation finished. No error reported.
2009-06-04T04:29:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	good :) now cd to /media/disk and type pwd, make sure it says /media/disk, make sure it is the larger of the two, type /pwd again, and make sure again, then type "rm -rf *".  This is an EXTREMLY dangerous thing to do so MAKE SURE you are on the larger partition, the one with all the boot files
2009-06-04T04:31:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	dione
2009-06-04T04:31:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	media/disk is now empty
2009-06-04T04:34:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	yea is see the folder named "marc"
2009-06-04T04:35:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	ok type "find . | cpio -pdvmu /media/disk" and open another terminal window, do not expect this command to finish untill about 30 mins
2009-06-04T04:36:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	whiule im cd'd into ../home?
2009-06-04T04:37:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	into /media/disk-1/home
2009-06-04T04:39:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	hmm something didnt quite work
2009-06-04T04:40:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	what happend?
2009-06-04T04:42:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	oh sorry that was ages ago im in my thosuandth terminal since then
2009-06-04T04:43:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	its going
2009-06-04T04:44:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	while it is going edit your /dev/disk-1/etc/fstab and change the mount point of /dev/sda6 from to /home
2009-06-04T04:47:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	change from /boot to /home? "/boot was on /dev/sda6 during installation" to "/home..."
2009-06-04T04:48:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	yes you now want to mount /dev/sda6 as home instead, you still have everything on /dev/sda2 in boot so it wil be fine
2009-06-04T04:50:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	saved and closed
2009-06-04T04:56:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	is that cpio still spitting out file names?
2009-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	yea
2009-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	no
2009-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	just finsihed
2009-06-04T04:58:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	ok look at /media/disk now and see if your home directory is there
2009-06-04T04:59:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	heck yea
2009-06-04T05:00:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	now go back to /media/disk-1/home and again make SURE you are there and type "rm -rf *"
2009-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	yes done
2009-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	home in disk-1 is now empty
2009-06-04T05:03:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	am i done?
2009-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	wrektjet_	mdm	still has 17 gigs. 11.4 free
2009-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	mdm	wrektjet_	yes, all you need do is reboot.
