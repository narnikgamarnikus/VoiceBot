2010-07-28T21:10:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	do you mean you want a default ubuntu desktop
2010-07-28T21:11:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	may be. i want my firefox and mouse icons things to be as that of when they were i installed first time lucid on my pc
2010-07-28T21:11:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	then use the default theme
2010-07-28T21:12:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	all that mouse theme is just messed up after removing kde. i cant just change mouse icons :(
2010-07-28T21:12:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	is this ubuntu and gnome
2010-07-28T21:13:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	yes
2010-07-28T21:13:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	so you installed kubuntu-desktop the uninstalled kde
2010-07-28T21:13:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	exactly
2010-07-28T21:14:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	and after that only that firerox and mouse icon problem starts (as I guess ;)  )

2010-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	I ssume you've tried purging and reinstalling them
2010-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	yah tried for pgadmin3. but no success.
2010-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	what about removing it's .config folder in home
2010-07-30T22:14:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	after removing using purge do i need to logout and login to reinstall it? or i can just start install in next line?
2010-07-30T22:14:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	let me try
2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	after removing using purge do i need to logout and login to reinstall it? or i can just start install in next line?
2010-07-30T22:16:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	never used that app before so dont know
2010-07-30T22:16:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	no. i am asking about sudo apt-get remove --purge thing
2010-07-30T22:17:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	no just reinstall . sudo apt-get purge XXX is all you need the reinstall
2010-07-30T22:17:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	okk
2010-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	i done purge to codelite but no success. still same error. :(
2010-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	Are thes apps from the regular ubuntu repo or ppa
2010-07-30T22:19:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	regular repo
2010-07-30T22:20:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	did it start after a kernel upgrade?
2010-07-30T22:20:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	no after that day kubutu removing stuff you gave me that web site link. remember? i was useful but it creates some side effects
2010-07-30T22:22:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	not sure what to suggest other than install kubuntu-desktop. I dont think those apps have any kde dependencies.
2010-07-30T22:23:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	ohhh. we just did lots of things that day to remove kubuntu. now i dont want to install it again. :(
2010-07-30T22:23:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	is your home on it's own partition
2010-07-30T22:24:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	no all in one / partition
2010-07-30T22:25:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	I wwould have suggested a reinstall with home on it's own partition But I'm at a loss
2010-07-30T22:26:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	you mean reinstall ubuntu? :-o
2010-07-30T22:26:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	not sure what you did before I gave you the psychocats link. That should just remove kde stuff
2010-07-30T22:27:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	:D
2010-07-30T22:27:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	i only paste that link as it is!!! :)
2010-07-30T22:27:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	I've used it myself before no problem
2010-07-30T22:27:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	I see
2010-07-30T22:28:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	post a thread in general help. Problems with pgadmin3 and codelite after removing kubuntu-desktop. In the thread post the errors
2010-07-30T22:29:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	you mena on ubuntu forums?
2010-07-30T22:29:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	yep
2010-07-30T22:29:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	okk
2010-07-30T22:29:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	Explain what you did
2010-07-30T22:29:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	okkk
2010-07-30T22:47:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	what if i just reinstall all that stuff again?
2010-07-30T22:48:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	That might work, could be some missing dependecy but i doubt it.
2010-07-30T22:48:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	ok.
2010-07-30T22:49:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	Depending on what you did it had to unravel. you might have to do a full reinstall at some point
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	no. i wll not reinstall. i have my ubuntu set now. reinstalling is total time consuming.
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	ok
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	should i just take risk of reinstalling kubuntu?
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	I have home on it's own partition so it very quick
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	i see
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	nothing to loose
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	okk
2010-07-30T22:51:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	you could look back through your bash_history to see exactly what you did
2010-07-30T22:51:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	how to view that?
2010-07-30T22:52:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	gedit ~/.bash_history
2010-07-30T22:53:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	should i pastebin it to show you?
2010-07-30T22:53:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	you only need to check the commands you issued before it all went borked
2010-07-30T22:54:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	ok
2010-07-30T23:00:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	i checked. and i done exactly whta give on that web site.
2010-07-30T23:00:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	Yes, but what did you do before that
2010-07-30T23:01:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	hey but we are missing one thing.
2010-07-30T23:02:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	both programs were running before doing that. so no need to check what i did before that. whatsay?
2010-07-30T23:02:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	Are you sure
2010-07-30T23:02:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	yes. sure about pgadmin3
2010-07-30T23:03:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	and also i checked. but nothing special related to any major component of os.
2010-07-30T23:04:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	You could modify that command to install instead of remove and remove the last bit of it
2010-07-30T23:04:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	ok.
2010-07-30T23:05:00.000Z	abhijit	philinux	i wll try that and report to you. thanks :)
2010-07-30T23:05:00.000Z	philinux	abhijit	I is off soon someone will help I'm sure
