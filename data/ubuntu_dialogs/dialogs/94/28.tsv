2009-09-07T20:59:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic> What happens when you try to boot the demo?
2009-09-07T21:01:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>When you downloaded the iso, did you do an "md5sum" check to verify?
2009-09-07T21:01:00.000Z	AFLunatic	Sidewinder1	no
2009-09-07T21:01:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		St
2009-09-07T21:01:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>Stand by, I type very slowly
2009-09-07T21:02:00.000Z	AFLunatic		k
2009-09-07T21:03:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic> That may be it. Do a search for a winbloze campatible "md5sum" program and check the hash against what you downloaded. If that checks out, maybe you burned to disk at too fast a speed. Do it as slow (3X?) as you can.
2009-09-07T21:04:00.000Z	AFLunatic		i just did a checksum on the iso
2009-09-07T21:04:00.000Z	AFLunatic		md5sum: WARNING: 67 of 68 listed files could not be read
2009-09-07T21:04:00.000Z	AFLunatic		md5sum: WARNING: 1 of 1 computed checksum did NOT match
2009-09-07T21:04:00.000Z	AFLunatic		That's what it says
2009-09-07T21:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>Found your problem!!!
2009-09-07T21:05:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Bad ISO?
2009-09-07T21:05:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Yes
2009-09-07T21:05:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Redownload
2009-09-07T21:06:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I downloaded the torrent
2009-09-07T21:06:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Cause it was extremely fast
2009-09-07T21:06:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I'm assuming I shouldn't download the torrent?
2009-09-07T21:06:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>Then chk md5sum, reburn at slow speed, you might want to clean your burner if it's dusty :-)
2009-09-07T21:07:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>Nothing wrong with torrents
2009-09-07T21:07:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Just to be clear, while running the md5sum.. the command is '>md5sum -c ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso'
2009-09-07T21:07:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Right?
2009-09-07T21:07:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>Go to a torrent site listed at ubuntu.com
2009-09-07T21:08:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>Looks right to me; the proof is the error messages that it returned.
2009-09-07T21:09:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Should I download 'Ubuntu alternate' or 'Ubuntu desktop'?
2009-09-07T21:10:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>After 11 hrs. I certainly understand your frustration!
2009-09-07T21:10:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Yea, i'm dying for sleep but not until I get this working
2009-09-07T21:10:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		desktop, you might want to try Hardy Heron as it's a long term service version.
2009-09-07T21:11:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>HH is what I'm using
2009-09-07T21:11:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Also, if you're tired may I make a suggestion?
2009-09-07T21:13:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic>You may wish to sleep and come back when you're fresh. I know I make more "bone-head" choices and decisions when I'm tired.

2009-09-07T21:34:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		tool> This is gonna sound like a dumb question, and I'm not trying to be insulting but did you click on the "All" button or "installed"?

2009-09-07T21:44:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		beasty> On occasion.
2009-09-07T21:45:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		m3f> It's GRUB that needs to be reinstalled.
2009-09-07T21:49:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	m3F	May very well be GRUB2, I know what it is but am unfamiliar with it's idiosyncrasies.

2009-09-07T21:54:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		And my wife says I'm pathetic. Hmmm
2009-09-07T21:54:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		What does she know?
2009-09-07T21:56:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		ROFL
2009-09-07T21:56:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		This is gonna be good. :-)
2009-09-07T21:57:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		I better keep my mouth shut while I'm ahead...
2009-09-07T21:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		No,...shut-up Side... Side slaps himself silly..
2009-09-07T23:12:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		m4x> Sounds like a hardware problem, mobo etc.
2009-09-07T23:14:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		m4x> Not if the problem is hardware related, ie: your motherboard or one of it's chips is bad. Try booting to live CD and see what happens.
2009-09-07T23:18:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		m4x> That's beyond my ability, sorry, but if you can boot by bypassing, if it keeps up, you could remove the vendor's partition. I would check with someone more knowlegable than I brfore doing that.

2009-09-08T00:23:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I desperately want Ubuntu
2009-09-08T00:15:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Anyone know a fix for the DRDY ERR?
2009-09-08T00:16:00.000Z	AFLunatic		How'd you get around it?
2009-09-08T00:16:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I've been at it for 13 hours
2009-09-08T00:17:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I've tried on 3 different hard drives
2009-09-08T00:17:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Installing ubuntu that is
2009-09-08T00:17:00.000Z	AFLunatic		There's no way it's the drive
2009-09-08T00:18:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I REALLY like ubuntu
2009-09-08T00:18:00.000Z	AFLunatic		But Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Xubuntu all do the same thing
2009-09-08T00:18:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I can't get it installed
2009-09-08T00:18:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Is there any other distro that is really similar to Kubuntu?
2009-09-08T00:20:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Is Fedora a lot like Ubuntu?
2009-09-08T00:20:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Anyone know how similar Fedora and Ubuntu are?
2009-09-08T00:23:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I just need something that's going to work
2009-09-08T00:23:00.000Z	AFLunatic		But it just will NOT install on my system
2009-09-08T00:23:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Not everyone can just go buy a system anytime they want
2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	AFLunatic		2 gigs
2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	AFLunatic		DRDY ERR
2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Whenever I boot from LiveCD
2009-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Or install inside of Windows
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I guess the DRDY ERR just doesn't have a fix
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	AFLunatic		lol
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Yes
2009-09-08T00:25:00.000Z	AFLunatic		I've been trying to install it for 13 and a half hours now
2009-09-08T00:27:00.000Z	AFLunatic		Yes, 2 others
2009-09-08T00:27:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		AFLunatic> How did you make out?
2009-09-08T00:27:00.000Z	AFLunatic		AMD 2800+
2009-09-08T00:27:00.000Z	AFLunatic	Sidewinder1	no go
