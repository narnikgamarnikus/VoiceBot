2011-09-02T20:39:00.000Z	thecpaptain_		yo guys, i'm trying to change the security of a router, and i'm trying to access it to do so, but I am unable to find the router's IP adress, or the one I find simply isn't working [16:27] <thecpaptain> right now i'm operating in windows, as I am unable to access the LAN via Ubuntu
2011-09-02T20:40:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Wired or WiFi?
2011-09-02T20:41:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Do you have permission from landlord?
2011-09-02T20:42:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	If so, the router's IP will more than likely be default route.  i.e.  192.168.1.1
2011-09-02T20:42:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Bring up the command prompt and issue command  ipconfig
2011-09-02T20:43:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	what is the route  (Default GW)
2011-09-02T20:43:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	take your browser to 10.0.1.1
2011-09-02T20:44:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	What is make and model of router?
2011-09-02T20:46:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Some routers have an option to only accept connection from wired and/or from one particular IP
2011-09-02T20:46:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Refer to router manual for details.
2011-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Sounds like you are unable to connect to the router because of unknown passphrase or wep key (password).  Right?
2011-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Is that correct?
2011-09-02T20:48:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Then what is the problem?  What exactly do you need to accomplish?
2011-09-02T20:51:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	- the original problem is that i'm unable to access the network using ubuntu
2011-09-02T20:52:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	You can not duplicate the process the windows PC uses?  Tell it to show you the passphrase, (or what ever).  What type of security is it using?
2011-09-02T20:53:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	If you're wondering what security the Router is using? I think its WPA2, but I'm guessing you're asking me to verify
2011-09-02T20:53:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Look at the connection configuration the Windows PC uses.
2011-09-02T20:54:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm yeah I just did, its WPA2-Personal
2011-09-02T20:54:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	SO that doesn't work for you on the Ubuntu machine?
2011-09-02T20:55:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm, I haven't verified it to be the actual reason, but talking to people have lead it to seem the most likely
2011-09-02T20:55:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Does the network-manager come up and ask for passphrase?
2011-09-02T20:55:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	i'm able to access other networks in Ubuntu, and it finds other networks and even the network i'm trying to access, it just keeps processing when i'm trying to access it
2011-09-02T20:55:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	yes, and it automatically sets it to WPA2-personal
2011-09-02T20:56:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	and even though I put the correct phrase, it doesn't allow me access
2011-09-02T20:56:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Ok then it is associating with the essid of the WiFi router? (But not acquirig IP info)?
2011-09-02T20:56:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Is that correct?
2011-09-02T20:57:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	no idea, I don't know what that means hehe. How do I find out ?
2011-09-02T20:57:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	iwconfig
2011-09-02T20:57:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	ifconfig
2011-09-02T20:58:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	so should i run iwconfig in windows ? or is it still ipconfig we're talking about ?
2011-09-02T20:58:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	and should i do it in windows or Ubuntu ?
2011-09-02T20:59:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	you there ?
2011-09-02T21:00:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	On the Ubuntu PC, open a terminal, type  iwconfig  (and hit enter)  THen type ifconfig (and hit enter).
2011-09-02T21:00:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	and then return, paste and give it to you, right ?
2011-09-02T21:00:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	I need to know since its this comp that i need to reboot in Ubuntu in order to do it
2011-09-02T21:01:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	that's why i'm so cautious before doing it ;)
2011-09-02T21:01:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	I see.
2011-09-02T21:01:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	should I go ahead and do it ?
2011-09-02T21:01:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	First, verify the wpa passphrase on the MS Windows side.
2011-09-02T21:02:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Tell the MS Windows PC to show the passphrase.
2011-09-02T21:02:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	aight, I'm positive i have the right one though
2011-09-02T21:02:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	got it, its verified
2011-09-02T21:03:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Give it a shot.
2011-09-02T21:03:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	aight, i'll log into the wonderful world of ubuntu and shall return to this shatroom shorty, brb
2011-09-02T21:03:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Ok, good luck
2011-09-02T21:18:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	here be the results http://paste.ubuntu.com/680730/
2011-09-02T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	You will need to compare and see if the essid is correct for the AP you are trying to connect to.
2011-09-02T21:20:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm, firstly, what is an essid, and how do i do that ?
2011-09-02T21:20:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm, firstly, what is an essid, and how do i do that ?
2011-09-02T21:22:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	any ideas ?
2011-09-02T21:22:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	 essid is the network name that a Wireless Access Point uses.  The first step in accessing a Wireless Access Point is getting the Wireless Network Adapter to assign itself the same essid that the Wireless Access Point uses.
2011-09-02T21:22:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm i see
2011-09-02T21:22:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	If there is encryption, that must be negotiated first.
2011-09-02T21:23:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm all right, so how do we find out whether the essids match ?
2011-09-02T21:25:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	any ideas ?
2011-09-02T21:26:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Once the proper passphrase is entered and received by the Wireless Access Point, the PC's Wireless Network Adapter can associate using the same essid (name) as the Wireless Access Point.  Then the PCs Wireless Network Adapter asks for IP information from the Wireless Access Point's DHCP server.  If the DHCP server receives the request and sends back proper IP information, the Wireless Network Adapter on your PC will use that information to establis
2011-09-02T21:26:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	to establish a connection
2011-09-02T21:26:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	We can not make all that stuff work, only you can.
2011-09-02T21:27:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	yeah I figured as much, but how do I go about doing it ?
2011-09-02T21:27:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	I have given you all the information I have.
2011-09-02T21:30:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	all right, if you don't have any further ideas then thank you for what you have so far provided :)
2011-09-02T21:30:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	so you don't think the problem might be the WPA2 connection and Ubuntu ?
2011-09-02T21:32:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Yes I DO think the problem is with the WPA2 authentication.  More than likely, yes.
2011-09-02T21:32:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	If y ou could turn off the encryption, that would do the trick.
2011-09-02T21:32:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	But we can not do that for you.  Only you can.
2011-09-02T21:32:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	and for that i need to access the router, hence the router's configuration challenge right ?
2011-09-02T21:33:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	You need to know the make and model of the router. YOu probably also need  a wired connection to it, etc.
2011-09-02T21:34:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hmm
2011-09-02T21:34:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	sudo iwconfig essid type-essid-here
2011-09-02T21:36:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	the ESSID i want to change to is the one that iwconfig showed me as Nickname:"XXXXX" ?
2011-09-02T21:36:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	There is one possibility and that is that network-manager is imporperly negotiating the wpa authentication.  In which case, you could switch to wicd.
2011-09-02T21:37:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	sudo apt-get remove network-manager ; sudo apt-get install wicd
2011-09-02T21:37:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	aight, should i try that before or after the Essid thingie ?
2011-09-02T21:39:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Yes
2011-09-02T21:40:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hm, the ssid seems to match the one in Network manager
2011-09-02T21:40:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	i'll try the wicd
2011-09-02T21:41:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	if i type the commands you showed me, will i not lose my internet connection before ubuntu is able to acquire the wicd ?
2011-09-02T21:44:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	 you there mate ?
2011-09-02T21:45:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Yes
2011-09-02T21:46:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	if i type the commands you showed me, will I not lose network manager before its able to install wicd ?
2011-09-02T21:46:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Yes, sorry I did that backwareds
2011-09-02T21:46:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	hehehe lucky i was awake
2011-09-02T21:46:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	i'll do them reverse then
2011-09-02T21:47:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	sudo apt-get install wicd ; sudo apt-get remove network-manager
2011-09-02T21:47:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	its necessary to remove network manager for it to work then ?
2011-09-02T21:47:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Sorry, my mistake.
2011-09-02T21:47:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	no worries, shit happens
2011-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	no need to apologize even :)
2011-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	but it is necessary to remove network manager ?
2011-09-02T21:48:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	or should I install wicd and try it without removing first ?
2011-09-02T21:49:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Yes
2011-09-02T21:49:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	sudo apt-get install wicd ; sudo apt-get remove network-manager
2011-09-02T21:49:00.000Z	thecpaptain_	usr13	got it
2011-09-02T21:53:00.000Z	usr13	thecpaptain_	Good.  Now try and connect again.
