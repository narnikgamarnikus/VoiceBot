2011-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	geek0292		anyone know an answer to my update problem? I HAVE done some digging, and found that some routers refer to the internal DHCP as the router's internal IP, which I've found to be true in this router through resolv.conf
2011-02-27T07:34:00.000Z	geek0292		who, me?
2011-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	geek0292		so, can I please get some help with this? I know you're all doing this on your own time, so no pressure.
2011-02-27T07:37:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	I hope the ECN feature in your kernel is closed, and ECN might cause some problem with some kinds of routers.(But in default the option is closed).
2011-02-27T07:37:00.000Z	geek0292		how do I check that?
2011-02-27T07:37:00.000Z	geek0292		and how do I type a message to a specific person? I'm a newbie when it comes to IRC.
2011-02-27T07:38:00.000Z	geek0292		kk
2011-02-27T07:38:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	use `sysctl -a | grep ecn'
2011-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	this is what I get when checking that, http://paste.ubuntu.com/572895/
2011-02-27T07:41:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	do I need to use sudo?
2011-02-27T07:42:00.000Z	c_		it's unnecessary to use sudo
2011-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	well, I'm getting a lot of "permission denied"s on the command.
2011-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	according to `http://www.bloke.com/linux/kernel/network.html', the ECN is open in your kernel.
2011-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	but on my laptop, it has the same value as you have.
2011-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	geek0292		hmmm, kk, so what does that mean? it's off?
2011-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	you can safely ignore that permission denied messages
2011-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	geek0292		ok, that's all I get.
2011-02-27T07:45:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	I take it that this means that it's turned off?
2011-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	maybe I use virtualbox or some other application which let the tcp_ecn turned on.
2011-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	geek0292		well, I have traced the IP in my resolv.conf file to the  router i'm using.
2011-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	c_		It's a boolean value, and if you set it to zero, you close that kernel option.
2011-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	geek0292		I'll pastebin the contents of my  resolv.conf file
2011-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	at the beginning of the URL I sent to you, you can use the command line to disable ecn option(and you need sudo that commadline).
2011-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	Have you try to open `http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/' in firefox ?
2011-02-27T07:50:00.000Z	geek0292		http://paste.ubuntu.com/572897/  that's my resolv.conf file.
2011-02-27T07:50:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	is your machine directly connected to the router with network cable?Or there are some other network devices between your machine and the router?
2011-02-27T07:51:00.000Z	geek0292		I've got it connected wirelessly to the router.
2011-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	geek0292		I've had a previous fix to that where I change the IP in the resolv.conf file to something, but I can't remember the command to edit it, nor what to change it to,
2011-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	ok. Can you open the repo by webbrowser(Firefox)?
2011-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	geek0292		what's the url?
2011-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	c_		`http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/'
2011-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	geek0292		I can get on there.
2011-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	geek0292		I believe it has problems downloading the files through update manager.
2011-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	have you checked the proxy settings in your desktop environment?
2011-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	geek0292		let me check
2011-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	Or the proxy settings in Synaptic.
2011-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	geek0292		Okay, how do I check the proxy setting in gnome?
2011-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	c_		In some circumstance, the router didn't rely dns lookup well, so if you know the DNS settings, you can set it in networkmanager or in the router's setting page.
2011-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	geek0292		in synaptic, it says "Direct connection to the internet"
2011-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	menu`System' -> `Control Center' -> `Network Proxy'
2011-02-27T07:58:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	can you do `update' in synaptic now?
2011-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	geek0292		no proxy used at all.
2011-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	geek0292		trying the update.
2011-02-27T08:01:00.000Z	geek0292		http://paste.ubuntu.com/572899/ error after I do a reload in synaptic
2011-02-27T08:03:00.000Z	geek0292		so, what might a possible fix be?
2011-02-27T08:04:00.000Z	geek0292		this also prevents a cache update in Ubuntu software center.
2011-02-27T08:05:00.000Z	c_		The file is small, so MTU issue can not affect the update process.
2011-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	I don't use the extra repo of ubuntu, so I'm not sure about the problem in this repo.
2011-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	so what can I do about this? like I've said, I've previously been able to update and everything by editing the resolv.conf file
2011-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	geek0292		and neiver do I.
2011-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	have you ever successfully updated this repo?
2011-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	geek0292		*neither
2011-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	geek0292		not here, but I can at my house.
2011-02-27T08:07:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	you mean now you use a different network connection than that you at home?
2011-02-27T08:08:00.000Z	geek0292		currently as I'm with relatives.
2011-02-27T08:10:00.000Z	geek0292		so, what can I do about this? I'd be okay with just editing my resolv.conf file if I knew  how and to what
2011-02-27T08:11:00.000Z	geek0292		because it's worked here in the past.
2011-02-27T08:11:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	I had the similiar experiences before, it's mainly due to the ISP or the network connection. You would like me to tell you how to edit the resolv.conf ?
2011-02-27T08:12:00.000Z	geek0292		yeah, and what a good IP for the file
2011-02-27T08:12:00.000Z	geek0292		if possible.
2011-02-27T08:13:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	Google Public DNS, Configure your network settings to use the IP addresses 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your DNS servers
2011-02-27T08:13:00.000Z	geek0292		btw, I use the same ISP at home, so I bet this could be their router.
2011-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	yeah, maybe.
2011-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	you can read this to configure the dns `http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html'
2011-02-27T08:14:00.000Z	c_		bochs, qemu
2011-02-27T08:18:00.000Z	geek0292		and the google thing turns me back to the original problem of updating where I can't resolve.
2011-02-27T08:19:00.000Z	geek0292		*sigh* guess I'll just wait to get home.... but it's gonna be frustrating with mail.....
2011-02-27T08:20:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	have you used the nslookup command to verify the hostname lookup?
2011-02-27T08:21:00.000Z	c_		the error msg is mainly due to dns error, and sometimes it's hard to resolve this problem. I often refresh serveal times to get all the package list successfully downloaded.
2011-02-27T08:23:00.000Z	geek0292		of course, dunno how to make sense of it, but the server IP matches the resolv.conf file I had up.
2011-02-27T08:25:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	you mean nslookup reports that the repo servers' ip is 192.168.x.x ?
2011-02-27T08:25:00.000Z	geek0292		yes
2011-02-27T08:25:00.000Z	geek0292		wait, repo? no, I checked google.
2011-02-27T08:26:00.000Z	geek0292		the server http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/ has 192.168.x.x
2011-02-27T08:27:00.000Z	geek0292		is the server address for that normal?
2011-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	the server address I get for http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/ is 192.168.x.x is this normal?
2011-02-27T08:35:00.000Z	geek0292	c_	have you got my messages?
2011-02-27T08:37:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	sorry, i left for a few minutes.
2011-02-27T08:37:00.000Z	geek0292		ok, well, is the server address for the repo "192.168.x.x" the actual server?
2011-02-27T08:38:00.000Z	geek0292		because it perfectly matches the router here.
2011-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	the address 192.168.x.x is lan address, it sould never be assigned to hosts on internet.
2011-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	geek0292		hmmmm, well looks like that's the problem with the update manager, huh?
2011-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	c_		I think it's DNS problem.
2011-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	geek0292		hmmm, so how should I go about fixing this?
2011-02-27T08:40:00.000Z	c_		the router ip address is 192.168.2.1 ?
2011-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	geek0292		yep
2011-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	geek0292		and that's the exact same IP i got for the repo,
2011-02-27T08:41:00.000Z	geek0292		AND google
2011-02-27T08:42:00.000Z	c_		You need a network cable to login in the router (if appliable) to see the status of the internet connection.
2011-02-27T08:42:00.000Z	c_		Sorry
2011-02-27T08:42:00.000Z	geek0292		well, I'll ask my mom if I can check that.
2011-02-27T08:42:00.000Z	c_		You should check the dns settings on router
2011-02-27T08:43:00.000Z	c_		Does the router have any host blacklist or time access control?
2011-02-27T08:44:00.000Z	c_	geek0292	normally, you need a network cable to connect your machine and the router so that you can get the router login page by webbrowser.
