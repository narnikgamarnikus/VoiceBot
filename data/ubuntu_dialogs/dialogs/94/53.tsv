2008-05-27T05:34:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	sudo that
2008-05-27T05:35:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	could not resolve ports.ubuntu.com.....
2008-05-27T05:35:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	What port are you using?
2008-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	it was on wireless, i just plugged wired in
2008-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	it works now
2008-05-27T05:37:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	done
2008-05-27T05:38:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	You copy and pasted lspci on paste.ubuntu.com? You need to copy and paste the URL and paste it here :P
2008-05-27T05:38:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	you're gonna get good at that ;)
2008-05-27T05:38:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	i did not yet, i cant figure out how to go to a website address!!!
2008-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	how do i go to the site?
2008-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	that's the lynx part  :)
2008-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	i know, i cant figure out how to use lynx
2008-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	lynx paste.ubuntu.com
2008-05-27T05:40:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	ah
2008-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	im trying to copy the error
2008-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Don't worry about it... install links2 instead (or elinks)
2008-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Or you mean the error from 'lspci' ?
2008-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	i installed it, but i mean the error from lspci
2008-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	how do i copy it?
2008-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	how do i paste?
2008-05-27T05:49:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	do you know how to paste?
2008-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	anyway.... we're going to do it the easy way... 'lspci > somefile && cat somefile | pastebinit'
2008-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Still use screen to copy and paste though, it's handy to learn
2008-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	im editing and i cant get out of the pastebin box
2008-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	nevermind
2008-05-27T05:51:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	paste is 'ctrl + a  then ]'
2008-05-27T05:53:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	pastebin.com/f394b6922
2008-05-27T05:53:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	sorry about that, reconnected by accident
2008-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	dpkg -l | grep nvidia <-- should return a few packages? if not, install 'linux-restricted-modules-generic' and reboot
2008-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	is that an L or a 1?
2008-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	heh... --list
2008-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	returned nothing, will install
2008-05-27T05:56:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	packadge ... is not available, but is referred to by another package
2008-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	packadge ... is not available, but is referred to by another package
2008-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	for now just install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24-17-generic explicitely...
2008-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	ok
2008-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	cant find packadge
2008-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	cant find packadge
2008-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` then ... note those are the dashes over by escape key
2008-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Not Hardy I take it?
2008-05-27T06:01:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	yes it is, but it is kubuntu, installed from ubuntu, would that change it?
2008-05-27T06:01:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	no... did the last command work?
2008-05-27T06:01:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	not the install linux-restricted...
2008-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	sudo aptitude update ... have errors?
2008-05-27T06:03:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	yes, quite a few.
2008-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	the correct way: sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm
2008-05-27T06:04:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	But you're online on that box right? Can you just type 'deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hardy main restricted' into /etc/apt/sources.list and comment out everything else?
2008-05-27T06:05:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	comment out == throw a # at the beginning of the line.
2008-05-27T06:05:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	how do i edit it, the only way i know uses gedit
2008-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list ... when you're done ctrl + x ... then y
2008-05-27T06:08:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	done
2008-05-27T06:09:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	still cant find it
2008-05-27T06:10:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	still cant find it
2008-05-27T06:12:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	I don't understand, seems something is wrong with your connection, but you're online.
2008-05-27T06:12:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	could you give me the package name again, maybe i typed it in wrong.
2008-05-27T06:13:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24-17-generic ... that doesn't work, replace 17 with 16 and try again... if that doesn't work, I'm unfortunately out of ideas.
2008-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	does not work, does it matter that i am on a ppc?
2008-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	last try: linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`
2008-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	fwiw, yes that was pretty relevant.
2008-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	package or command
2008-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	package....
2008-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	it is rung 17 now, and that seems to have done somthing
2008-05-27T06:16:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	nope
2008-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	aptitude search linux-restricted-modules return anything?
2008-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	yes, what you said exept instead of generic, powerpc
2008-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Try that... -generic is x86
2008-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	will wireless work in text based?
2008-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Sure, but I'm not familiar with how to set it up.
2008-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	man interfaces then type /wlan
2008-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	You mean the login?
2008-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	i wireless works
2008-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	uhh... /wireless even ... anyway man iwconfig looks simple en... it's up?
2008-05-27T06:24:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	it is up, seems to be automatic
2008-05-27T06:24:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	haha... I told you that about an hour ago I think... but you were up on wired...
2008-05-27T06:24:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	bad thing with stuff just working, you don't learn how to do it less it goes wrong.
2008-05-27T06:25:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	16 was installed, so i just installed 17, i want to see what happens
2008-05-27T06:25:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	what does uname -r return?
2008-05-27T06:26:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	If that says -17 ... then that is why nvidia broke.
2008-05-27T06:26:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	hold on, restarting
2008-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	a ton of stuff came up when i booted again, now it seems to be stuck at running local boot scripts
2008-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	how much you get paid?
2008-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Does it appear to be going better? GUI?
2008-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	no gui yes, but im am messing around with what i can do.
2008-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	IT WORKS (sorry for caps)
2008-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	What you do?
2008-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	installed 17, then did sudo restart now, which for some reason gave me a strange menu where one of the options was fix broken packages, so i said, what the heck, why not, then hit that, and it fixed stuff, then the same menu came back, and one of the options was resume normal boot, so i did that, and it showed a ton of stuff that took a long time, but now i see my login screen
2008-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	i just realized how long that sentence was.
2008-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	haha... well I'm glad it worked... next time state arch MUCH quicker... Ubuntu is dropping PPC, so I didn't even think to ask about it. (well no, it's going to ports, which you did state, it just didn't register)
2008-05-27T06:43:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	thank you so much, but one more thing. while tring to fix it, i switch graphical manger to gnome, how do i change it back to kde?
2008-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	If that doesn't ask though... 'echo /usr/sbin/kdm | sudo tee /etc/X11/default-desktop-manager
2008-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	Simonft	fde	the fist one works, thank you so much.
2008-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	fde	Simonft	Most welcome  :)
