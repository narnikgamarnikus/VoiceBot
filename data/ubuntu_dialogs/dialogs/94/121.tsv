2005-04-04T15:17:00.000Z	CoRzA		Hey guys I'm having a problem with my screen resolution it's set to 60hz and i cant change it
2005-04-04T15:18:00.000Z	CoRzA		i am absolutely sure
2005-04-04T15:20:00.000Z	CoRzA		oh ok - wouldnt it be easier to somehow edit it?
2005-04-04T15:21:00.000Z	CoRzA		but i'm willing to try
2005-04-04T15:22:00.000Z	CoRzA		Kanotix is a distro yeah?/
2005-04-04T15:22:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	you have to set horiz and vert sync
2005-04-04T15:23:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	how?
2005-04-04T15:23:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	grep 'Horiz' in xorg.conf
2005-04-04T15:24:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	thats in etc?
2005-04-04T15:24:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	/etc/X11/xorg.conf or thereabouts
2005-04-04T15:25:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	it says read only?
2005-04-04T15:25:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	chmod +w myfile
2005-04-04T15:26:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	ok i'm not great on the lingo i sorta know what chmod is from web servers but i dont know how to do it on linux
2005-04-04T15:27:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	cd /etc/X11  and then    chmod u+w ./xorg.conf
2005-04-04T15:28:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	sudo -s
2005-04-04T15:30:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	root can delete all files in this mode.
2005-04-04T15:30:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	I'm new to sudo (and ubuntu) -- I'm a debian person.
2005-04-04T15:31:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	& eyequeue, yes i'm sorta aware of that :) thanks
2005-04-04T15:31:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	thank me with /nick corza  hi hi
2005-04-04T15:32:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	did that do something?
2005-04-04T15:33:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	did what do what? /he indirectly references to further obscure the conversation
2005-04-04T15:34:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	ok back umm just about to sorta fix it all up
2005-04-04T15:34:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	just guide me through if u can
2005-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	nosleep here 24 h.  what are we doing again?
2005-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	it has here... HorizSync 28-49 and VertRefresh 43-72
2005-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	the umm changing of screen hz
2005-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	right!
2005-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	vert
2005-04-04T15:36:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	flat
2005-04-04T15:36:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	no crt
2005-04-04T15:38:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	if anything bad happens shut off the CRT power IMMEDIATELY.
2005-04-04T15:39:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	look at the parameters.  There's a button that echoes some of them to the xterm
2005-04-04T15:39:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	would it be safer to look up the specs of my monitor?
2005-04-04T15:39:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	in a way sure. do u have 'em?
2005-04-04T15:39:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	i could :S
2005-04-04T15:40:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	i'll just check
2005-04-04T15:40:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	u want to know how many MHz the CRT can be pushed to.
2005-04-04T15:40:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	yes
2005-04-04T15:40:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	umm my firefox isnt working :S
2005-04-04T15:41:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	mozilla better
2005-04-04T15:41:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	comes up page cant be displayed
2005-04-04T15:41:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	don't worry about it.  you can tune it.
2005-04-04T15:42:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	xvidtune will not let you go past the limits of those horiz and vertical timings we saw earlier; if they're too permisive you can fry the CRT.
2005-04-04T15:43:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	where do i find xvidtune?
2005-04-04T15:43:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	what happens is X11 reads xorg.conf which tells it the extreme operating ranges of the CRT hardware. So the human (you) decides that range.
2005-04-04T15:43:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	'which xvidtune'
2005-04-04T15:44:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	bring it up one step at a time: 85, then 90, then 95, then 100.
2005-04-04T15:44:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	be sure X11 is totally stopped between iterations.
2005-04-04T15:44:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	where is xvidtune?
2005-04-04T15:45:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	traditionally, /usr/X11R6/bin/X11/xvidtune, iirc
2005-04-04T15:46:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	ok found it
2005-04-04T15:46:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	umm i cant change xorg.conf
2005-04-04T15:46:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	if the CRT fails to sync power it down IMMEDIATELY. or if it makes a high-pitched whine.
2005-04-04T15:47:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	chmod u+w /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-04T15:48:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	i done that..
2005-04-04T15:48:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	i opened it in gedit
2005-04-04T15:51:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	you still there?
2005-04-04T15:51:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	yes
2005-04-04T15:52:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	it has a maximum of 120hz so i'll be sorta fine
2005-04-04T15:52:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	yep. 120 vert is good for u then. don't exceed it in xorg.conf okay?
2005-04-04T15:52:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	yes how do i edit it i'm in gedit and it wont let me edit it and i have changed the permissions
2005-04-04T15:53:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	ls -la /etc/X11/xorg.conf should say what current write perms are
2005-04-04T15:54:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	it says no such file or directory
2005-04-04T15:54:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	may be a case change.  Xorg.conf or whatever.
2005-04-04T15:54:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	oh wait i typed it in wrong
2005-04-04T15:55:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	good.
2005-04-04T15:55:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	that means root (the USER in chmod u+w) can write to that file.
2005-04-04T15:56:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	ah ok soooo how do I the root user write to that file?
2005-04-04T15:57:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	by proper use of your text editor.  gedit is a GUI-based text editor right? file->save probably
2005-04-04T15:57:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	i cant type anything...
2005-04-04T15:58:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	what text editor do u use habitually?
2005-04-04T15:58:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	this is my first day on it hehe
2005-04-04T15:58:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	Pizbit is saying lots of germaine stuph here. Be sure not to skip his comments okay?
2005-04-04T16:01:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	how do i edit the file??
2005-04-04T16:01:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	Pizbit is telling u.
2005-04-04T16:05:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	change it from 72 to 90. test. increment slowly towards 120.
2005-04-04T16:10:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	and?
2005-04-04T16:13:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	>>hey??<< we dont know how to answer that question.  stop asking it. ;)
2005-04-04T16:13:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	lol!!
2005-04-04T16:18:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	umm it sorta hasnt changed anything i cant change it from 60hz
2005-04-04T16:19:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	control  alt +    or control alt -
2005-04-04T16:19:00.000Z	CoRzA	nis	ok um my screen is weird.....

2005-04-04T16:21:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	not a problem. iterate that keypress again and again. slowly.
2005-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	when it does that iterate it AGAIN.  You're stepping thru various vid modes.
2005-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	yea.
2005-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	it wraps around to the first mode when it finds the last mode.
2005-04-04T16:25:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	can u do the nick thing pls
2005-04-04T16:26:00.000Z	nis	CoRzA	/nick corza
