2009-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	zortec		Does anyone have the P6NGM2 (MS-7518) motherboard with the nVidia GeForce 7050/610i chipset.  I am trying to find a manual on the video card to see what resolutions it can support.  Any ideas?
2009-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	zortec		Much appreciated if you can point me to where there is a manual.
2009-10-27T11:23:00.000Z	zortec		Are there manuals available from nvidia's website on graphic cards? I haven't found any
2009-10-27T11:23:00.000Z	zortec		I checked MSI and they didn't have any info on that particular video chipset
2009-10-27T11:23:00.000Z	indus	zortec	what kind of manuals?
2009-10-27T11:23:00.000Z	indus	zortec	check the manufacturer site
2009-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	zortec	indus	I am trying to find a manual on the NVIDIA MCP 73U chipset
2009-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	indus	zortec	hmm nvidia have it as a pdf on the site i believe so
2009-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	zortec	indus	Yeah I'm having trouble finding where they have pdf files on the site
2009-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	indus	zortec	if you can locate the chipset on the site that is
2009-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	indus	zortec	its on the left block somewhere
2009-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	zortec	indus	I haven't had any luck in tracking down that particular chipset
2009-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	indus	zortec	where is this chipset used?
2009-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	zortec	indus	Not sure I understand the question
2009-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	indus	zortec	is this on a motherboard?
2009-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	zortec	indus	I have d/l the motherboard manual, but it does not have much about the chipset so that is why I have been at nvidia's site
2009-10-27T11:31:00.000Z	zortec	indus	This is all the information I have
2009-10-27T11:31:00.000Z	zortec	indus	http://pastebin.com/d35f8275
2009-10-27T11:33:00.000Z	indus	zortec	hmm so what problem do u have wit h it
2009-10-27T11:33:00.000Z	indus	zortec	i think google is showing lots of stuff on it
2009-10-27T11:33:00.000Z	indus	zortec	none of those good?
2009-10-27T11:33:00.000Z	zortec	indus	the problem I have is what I find out the supported resolutions of that chipset since I am looking at upgrading the monitor
2009-10-27T11:34:00.000Z	zortec	indus	so I need to find out what monitors I can buy with that chipset
2009-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	zortec	indus	I can't find the technical specs on that chipset
2009-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	indus	zortec	hmm do you think some monitors wont work with it?
2009-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	zortec	indus	it's possible if I get one with a super high res
2009-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	zortec	indus	so would rather not take my chances
2009-10-27T11:37:00.000Z	indus	zortec	unlikely
2009-10-27T11:37:00.000Z	indus	zortec	its old chipset right?
2009-10-27T11:37:00.000Z	zortec	indus	hmm. but still, nvidia should provide info on the chipset, no?
2009-10-27T11:37:00.000Z	indus	zortec	yeah
2009-10-27T11:39:00.000Z	zortec	indus	sure I can do trial and error, but I know it supports vga and dvi... what I want to know is the max res supported by nvidia geforce 7050/nforce 610i chipset
2009-10-27T11:39:00.000Z	indus	zortec	wait
2009-10-27T11:40:00.000Z	indus	zortec	geforce 7050 basically
2009-10-27T11:40:00.000Z	zortec	indus	yeah, basically
2009-10-27T11:41:00.000Z	zortec	indus	is there a pdf available on the 7050?
2009-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	indus	zortec	interestingly ther isnt any for the 7050
2009-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	indus	zortec	need to report to nvidia this
2009-10-27T11:43:00.000Z	zortec	indus	what do you mean there isn't any? that is odd...
2009-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	indus	zortec	got it
2009-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	indus	zortec	http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_35712.html
2009-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	indus	zortec	i suggest you go to MSI website, and check it
2009-10-27T11:44:00.000Z	indus	zortec	iam sure it will be there
2009-10-27T11:45:00.000Z	zortec	indus	but where do you find resolution in that?
2009-10-27T11:47:00.000Z	indus	zortec	got it wait
2009-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	indus	zortec	cant find res but what monitor are you talking abbout?
2009-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	indus	zortec	best is manufacturer page but it should support upto 1900 and above easy
2009-10-27T11:48:00.000Z	zortec	indus	yeah that is what I was trying to find
2009-10-27T11:49:00.000Z	indus	zortec	K9NGM3 board?
2009-10-27T11:50:00.000Z	indus	zortec	it has single link DVI support so be careful
2009-10-27T11:50:00.000Z	zortec	indus	MS-7518
2009-10-27T11:51:00.000Z	indus	zortec	Blazing-fast RAMDAC supports display with high, ergonomic refresh rates up to and including 1920x1440@75Hz.

2009-10-27T11:51:00.000Z	zortec	indus	P6NGM2-L
2009-10-27T11:52:00.000Z	indus	zortec	so dont expect 1080p res
2009-10-27T11:52:00.000Z	indus	zortec	its integrated so what u expect
2009-10-27T11:52:00.000Z	indus	zortec	but check with MSI for specifics
2009-10-27T11:52:00.000Z	zortec	indus	where did you find that? I see the 7050
2009-10-27T11:52:00.000Z	zortec	indus	but not the 610i on there
2009-10-27T11:53:00.000Z	indus	zortec	610 is the southbridge for media storage and communications , nothing to do with display
2009-10-27T11:54:00.000Z	zortec	indus	where do you see the res?
2009-10-27T11:54:00.000Z	indus	zortec	its mentioned keep reading
