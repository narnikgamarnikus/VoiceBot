2008-03-25T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	depends on the error
2008-03-25T02:15:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	 unended #ifndef and include/linux/pci.h:72: Error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before Â»typedef
2008-03-25T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	thats not really enough, you need about 20 lines of output at least
2008-03-25T02:19:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/m293dfca7 there is the error i translated some messages from german to english
2008-03-25T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	looks like your headers differ from your kernel version (but reading your earlier comment I don't think thats the case)
2008-03-25T02:21:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	isnt there a way to check that?
2008-03-25T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	well, are all your packages from the ubuntu repo, what version of the kernel are you playing with
2008-03-25T02:23:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/m5312589c theres my usr/Src folder
2008-03-25T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	that all looks spot on
2008-03-25T02:24:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	why are you re-compiling the kernel, what are you changing ?
2008-03-25T02:24:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i need for an application static oss compiled instead of alsa
2008-03-25T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	and thats all you've changed, you used the same .config from the ubuntu source package
2008-03-25T02:25:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	 i didnt change anything
2008-03-25T02:26:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i used: sudo make oldconfig
2008-03-25T02:26:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	Hmmm and thats failing, interesting
2008-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i have no idea what im doing wrong
2008-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	oldconfig should work, I can't see anything obvious
2008-03-25T02:31:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	ist there kind of a checkinstall option?
2008-03-25T02:34:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	after a clean up and recompile it crashes on another step
2008-03-25T02:34:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	way earlier than before
2008-03-25T02:41:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	any idea how to check
2008-03-25T02:42:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	im back in a few trying to check my ram
2008-03-25T02:58:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	are you there?
2008-03-25T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	I am now,
2008-03-25T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	I had to pop out
2008-03-25T02:59:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i found the error 99,99% it is the error what i found
2008-03-25T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	what is the problem
2008-03-25T02:59:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	its my ram
2008-03-25T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	oooh really, thats a good find
2008-03-25T03:00:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i made a test in my bios and that said everything fine
2008-03-25T03:00:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	but memtest on ubuntu says errors and errors
2008-03-25T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	good find, well done
2008-03-25T03:01:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	after removing each after another and rechecking i found the buggy ram.. but i can bring it back for guaruantee
2008-03-25T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	excellent
2008-03-25T03:01:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	 but thanks anyway for trying to help me... i appreciate it
2008-03-25T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	you helped yourself, thats the best help there is, well done
2008-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	how did you install it
2008-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	read the script and what it does, then undo it
2008-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	thats one of the draw backs of not using a package manager
2008-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i looked through the script but cant find something to uninstall
2008-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	avira wasnt in the distros so ;)
2008-08-14T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	well, you can either work through the script, or contact the avira vendors and ask them for support
2008-09-24T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	depends what your router will support
2008-09-24T15:55:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	router will support any dns server
2008-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	your router can have any dns server installed on it ?
2008-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	what OS is your router running
2008-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	no i think we missed each other in this conversation. i can set manually dns server ips and i want to set the one to my little lan one
2008-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	oh, just use bind then
2008-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	"bind" is a dns server?
2008-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	it is
2008-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	thanks a lot ill try it
2008-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	can you help again? iev found bind9 and already installed is bind9-host which one to use?
2008-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	you need bind9
2008-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	isnt dnsmasq easier to configure for my purpose?
2008-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	it's up to you
2008-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	you asked for opinions, I said bind
2008-09-24T16:10:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	your right, but i found just dnsmasq havent seen it before and thought it might be easier to configure and to maintain
2008-09-24T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	in my opinion, no
2008-11-19T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	emmulate it for what
2008-11-19T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	what you want to use it for will define how it maybe possible
2008-11-19T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	what application are you using ?
2008-11-19T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	just chose another input output port, say IR, bluetooth, etc etc
2008-11-19T12:50:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	sorry didnt get what you mean
2008-11-19T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	I assume you mean a serial port as a comport (maybe wrong assumption)
2008-11-19T12:51:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	IR/blueooth etc are all "com ports"
2008-11-19T12:51:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	RS232, serial, com port and in the future it will be connected to a kind of a microkontroller
2008-11-19T12:51:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	ah, I don't blieve you can just make a device node for it , no
2008-11-19T12:51:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	sorry for not talking about the whole thing its 7 o'clock in the morning ;)
2008-11-19T12:53:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	how about loop mount from one /dev/ttyx to /dev/ttyx+1 ? and connect to them
2008-11-19T12:54:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	you don't mount com ports
2008-11-19T12:58:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	http://www.tibbo.com/vspdl.php is that maybe what im lookin for?
2008-11-19T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	could work
2008-11-19T12:59:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	thanks for your answers and ill give it a shot now
2008-11-19T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	I've never seen that packages
2008-11-19T13:01:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	just found it on a forum
2010-06-14T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	no
2010-06-14T03:39:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	it seems many other people are having problems: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1306333&page=1
2010-06-14T03:40:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	transfers under Debian with the same external drive are 'normal' for USB 2.0. hdparm suggests slow RW also on Ubuntu.
2010-06-14T03:41:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	a lot of those posts are firmware specific
2010-06-14T03:42:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i see. i have installed no firmware to support this Western Digital drive on either Ubuntu or Debian.
2010-06-14T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	that you know of
2010-06-14T03:44:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	it is a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.10. i am an experienced Debian user of some 12 years and am sure i have not installed any firmware to support this brand new external device.
2010-06-14T03:44:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i suspect a problem at the kernel level, as some bug reports suggest.
2010-06-14T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	what about the firmware that's built into the kernel ?
2010-06-14T03:44:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	yes, this is my suspicion
2010-06-14T03:47:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	searching further i see a great many people struggling with transfer rates to USB 2.0 compliant mass storage devices. i'll try an upgrade of Ubuntu and report back if i note improvements with hdparm et al.
2010-11-16T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	they are environment variables
2010-11-16T15:15:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	yes i know that. as i said, i'm used to gentoo for example, where i can set them in /etc/make.conf permanently. if i wish to change them for one single compilation, i can set them temporarily of course. but i don't want to do it every time.
2010-11-16T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	set it in your shell
2010-11-16T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	that way everytime your shell is launched it's alaready set
2010-11-16T15:17:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i thought about that, i was just curious if there's another way, exclusively for make settings to be stored. but thank you, i guess there's nothing alike. just wanted to be sure :-)
2010-11-16T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	julian_	gentoo does it's own thing
2010-11-16T15:18:00.000Z	julian_	ikonia	i know. just an idea because i used it for a long time, i'm still "thinking gentoo" i guess ;-)
