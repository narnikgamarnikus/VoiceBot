2006-11-12T10:07:00.000Z	dk0r		Why can't I find Firefox 2 in Synaptic ?
2006-11-12T10:08:00.000Z	dk0r		Why can't I find Firefox 2 in Synaptic ?
2006-11-12T10:08:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-11-12T10:08:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	6.06 doesn't have firefox 2
2006-11-12T10:08:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	So i cannot install it?
2006-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	you can, but not through the package manager (unless you upgrade to 6.10).  Do you want the instructions on installing it without using the apckage manager?
2006-11-12T10:09:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	Sure. Got a link? I downloaded the file from mozillas site, but i dont know what to do with it.
2006-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	thanks
2006-11-12T10:10:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	np
2006-11-12T10:11:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	What is libstdc++5 ? That page says it needs to be installed, but gives no reason why or what it is.
2006-11-12T10:12:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	libstdc++5 - The GNU Standard C++ Library v3
2006-11-12T10:12:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	Is that allready installed on 6.06 ?
2006-11-12T10:13:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	you can check with   apt-cache policy libstdc++5
2006-11-12T10:13:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	well you could check the same thing in synaptic too
2006-11-12T10:14:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	Will do. But I need to learn command line anyways. Does that bot have a link to an apt-get command line tutorial ?
2006-11-12T10:15:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	 Thanks again.
2006-11-12T10:22:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	you can set one in system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
2006-11-12T10:22:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	 Thank you.
2006-11-12T10:31:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	how are you trying to paste?  What are you pressing?
2006-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	cntrl+v
2006-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	ctrl-shift-v
2006-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	for terminal only ?
2006-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	yeah, ctrl-v means something else in terminal
2006-11-12T10:32:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	figured. But what?
2006-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	try ctrl-v ctrl-v  (it inserts the literal character that you pressed)
2006-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	Gotcha. But of what use is that?
2006-11-12T10:33:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	I've used it to search for
2006-11-12T10:34:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	^M in a file
2006-11-12T10:34:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	What does ^M do ?
2006-11-12T10:34:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	What does ^M result in when searching for it?
2006-11-12T10:39:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	because it's probably a symlink to a place outside your ~ that you don't have proper permissions for
2006-11-12T10:39:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	Right. because I keep getting a Permission Denied error.
2006-11-12T10:40:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	But how can it be outside my ~/ if it is "~/Examples"
2006-11-12T10:40:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	try 'ls -ld ~/Examples'
2006-11-12T10:40:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	But how can Examples be outside my ~/ if it is "~/Examples"
2006-11-12T10:40:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	the symlink is in ~, but the symlink points to /usr/share/example-content/
2006-11-12T10:41:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	symlink = shortcut ?
2006-11-12T10:41:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	same idea
2006-11-12T10:41:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	ok. What is 'ls -ld ~/Examples' ?
2006-11-12T10:42:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	ls lists stuff, -l lists lots of info, -d makes it list directory info, not stuff inside the directory.  Type  'man ls' for more details
2006-11-12T10:42:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	/ warkruid: thanks
2006-11-12T10:49:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	cd ..,  but just 'cd' takes you to home
2006-11-13T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	^
2006-11-15T08:41:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	it's a warninng, you can ignore it
2007-08-01T08:53:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	why compile it?  It's in the multiverse repository
2007-08-03T13:30:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	type 'cd Comm' and then press TAB, you are not escaping the & properly
2007-08-04T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	mplayer plugin is in the multiverse repository, use your favorite package manager to install it.  Don't compile it
2007-08-04T06:08:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	kitche Im just trying to get mplayer to work w/ firefox as described here http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:NZWdkHE6-OEJ:linux-sxs.org/multimedia/mplayermozplug.html+mplayer+firefox&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us
2007-08-04T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	ignore that site, just enable multiverse and install the 'mozilla-mplayer' package
2007-08-04T06:09:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	how do i enable multiverse ?
2007-08-04T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	system -> administration -> software sources
2007-08-04T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	yes
2007-08-04T06:18:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	weird. because i apt-get installed it before i enabled multiverse.
2007-08-04T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	then it was enabled before
2007-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	I went into my sources list and only main was listed. no universe or multi
2007-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	are there other places uni/multiverse can be checked on besides the default sources "deb http:.... main" line?
2007-08-04T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	that's not possible afaict, you can pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list if you want or not if you don't care :)
2007-08-04T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	/etc/apt/sources.list.d/* is checked too
2007-08-04T06:20:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	hm.. idk what sources.list.d is
2007-08-04T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	it's just a directory that apt checks too
2007-08-04T06:23:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	restart your browser and visit a site like http://www.linspire.com/products_linspire_whatis.php?tab=compatibility
2007-08-04T06:23:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	wow thats an awesome site!!
2007-08-04T06:24:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	wmv's not working. what do I do ?!
2007-08-04T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	have you installed w32codecs?  Make sure it's actually mplayer that is the player too btw
2007-08-04T06:24:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	i havent installed those codecs. Where do I ensure mplayer is default player? in firefox prefs?
2007-08-04T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	you can do 'about:config' in your browser, or just look at the player and right click on it then go to 'about' or something
2007-08-04T06:26:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	 totem removed
2007-08-04T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	be sure to close all instances of firefox and open it again after that
2007-08-04T06:27:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	getting codecs
2007-08-04T06:32:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	I added their repos to my list, but what is the name of the pkg for w32codecs? BEtter yet, how do I find it myself??
2007-08-04T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	it's "w32codecs" for the name
2007-08-04T06:34:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	i believe itried that.
2007-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	Package w32codecs is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2007-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org for pasting error message.  Can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list  ?
2007-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	 i did an update after I added them to source.
2007-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	sure

2007-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	sure
2007-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	this is ridiculous. its going to time out
2007-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	can i just compile it myself?
2007-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	dk0r	it's not going to time out... the other mirrors work fine, try the playboymansion one
2007-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	dk0r	jrib	k
