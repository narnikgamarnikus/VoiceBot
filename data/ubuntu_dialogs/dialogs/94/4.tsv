2012-03-08T09:42:00.000Z	Lirth		When I try to install or boot from my flash drive I get the black screen. I was told to use nomodeset but I can't figure out how to use it.
2012-03-08T09:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	what GPU do you use?
2012-03-08T09:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	us:  nouveau.blacklist=1    instead
2012-03-08T09:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	*use
2012-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	How do I do that? This is my first time building a computer.
2012-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	hold shift at boot
2012-03-08T09:45:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Nothing happened differently. It just went to the GRUB again.
2012-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	how do I add the boot options? The shift thing does work.
2012-03-08T09:50:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	That's one of my problems. I can only access GRUB when I boot. I can't get the welcome screen.
2012-03-08T09:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	yes, thats because the nouveau driver is loading and your chip doesn't like it, hence the boot option
2012-03-08T09:51:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	So how do I edit it? With the command line?
2012-03-08T09:56:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I have no idea what happened differently. Before I couldn't even access what you were describing in the page. Then I got it to work magically. Any idea what I may have done differently?
2012-03-08T09:58:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Do you know much about the nvidia drivers and which one I would have to download?
2012-03-08T09:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	there are drivers in the ubuntu repos. You may need the xorg edgers update ppa as your chip will benefit from the 290 driver but its easily nstalled
2012-03-08T10:00:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I only started Linux in January. Could you simplify that?
2012-03-08T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	the driver is in the ubuntu servers ready for you. You don't have to maually download anything
2012-03-08T10:13:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I tried it and it worked! I have no idea what I did differently.
2012-03-08T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	what is the key?
2012-03-08T10:14:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	What is a key?
2012-03-08T10:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	to add the boot option>
2012-03-08T10:15:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I have no idea. I've been running into so many irregular problems. I had something with caching for the first day but that vanished quickly. Today I had the driver thing. I just booted regularly and it worked somehow.
2012-03-08T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	anything you can pass on to no-name-
2012-03-08T10:17:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I have no idea what I did.
2012-03-08T10:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	was afraid you'd say that
2012-03-08T10:18:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Yeah. I didn't do anything differently. It just worked.
2012-03-08T10:22:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	no-name-: I think I hit escape but I'm not sure. I know once I got to that screen f6 had the option I needed.
2012-03-08T11:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	is software centre or synaptic open, or are you installing updates or new apps?
2012-03-08T11:01:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	the bootloader installer thingy is open from earlier when it ran into an error
2012-03-08T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	yes, all one command
2012-03-08T11:04:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	"Bad address"
2012-03-08T11:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a     is the command....
2012-03-08T11:07:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Errors in man-db
2012-03-10T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-03-10T05:23:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Do you want me to run that code in the terminal?
2012-03-10T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	please, select to upload to the server and a URL will be made, what is it please
2012-03-10T05:26:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=ec23669c5a30992323bf6930313763116b3d1894
2012-03-10T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	if you run:  alsamixer    are all levels unmuted and cranked?
2012-03-10T05:28:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I have no idea how to tell. I've never used it before.
2012-03-10T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	then try it....
2012-03-10T05:31:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	There are: Master (green), Headphones (red) PCM (Red) Front (red) Front Mi (empty) <other> Front Mi (green) Surround (red) Center (red). I have no idea what each level means or what the names are.
2012-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	are the levels high though?
2012-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	and unmuted. You can use M to unmute
2012-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	All except three are at the max.
2012-03-10T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	max the others if you can
2012-03-10T05:34:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Some have green highight to the letters. How do I tell if with green or without green is mute?
2012-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	use cursors and M, press ESC to exit
2012-03-10T05:36:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I tested both green highlight and without the highlight. Neither way I got sound'
2012-03-10T05:40:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I tested both settings after placing it and exiting. Neither worked.
2012-03-10T05:52:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I tried the sound thing and still nothing. Any idea what I should do next?
2012-03-10T05:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	does the system have a make and model?
2012-03-10T05:54:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Nope. It's my first home built computer.
2012-03-10T05:54:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	But it also doesn't work on my laptop which is an HP Pavilion dv6
2012-03-10T05:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	for the HP DV6 you may need to run:    echo "options snd-hda-intel model=dell-m4-1 enable_msi=2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf     and reboot
2012-03-10T06:03:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I tried that and it says it can't find the file or directory.
2012-03-10T06:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	well yeah, if its released it's not in beta..
2012-03-10T06:38:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	But was it "ready for prime time"?
2012-03-10T06:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	according to the devs, yes
2012-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	You helped me get my laptop audio working a bit ago. How do you think I'd do that for my desktop?
2012-03-10T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	do what?
2012-03-10T06:53:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Get my sound working. It's not for some reason.
2012-03-10T09:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	check the appdb, see which is friendliest
2012-03-10T09:09:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Or "PlayOnLinux"?
2012-03-10T09:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	thats a gui but the backend doing the work is wine
2012-03-10T09:10:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Ahh...
2012-03-10T09:11:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	When you say "friendliest", what do you mean?
2012-03-10T09:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	the appdb shows what works and such, as well as the seam used
2012-03-10T09:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	and wine used
2012-03-10T09:13:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	So when I found Steam in the list and looked at it, it showed "Wine Version 1.3.37". Does that mean I should get 1.3? Also, why would one version work better than another? Are the numbers not released linearly like the Ubuntu releases (10.04 -> 10.11 -> 11.04 -> 11.0)
2012-03-10T09:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	if you get wine 1.3 for your release it will work as well as it states in the appdb
2012-03-10T09:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	the things should get added top your system menus like normal apps. they are in stalled to ~/.wine/drive_c
2012-03-10T09:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	right click the top bar, its there
2012-03-10T09:36:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	dr_willis: I feel dumb now. Thanks
2012-03-10T09:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	its all learning, so its cool B)
2012-03-10T09:37:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Except that it was explained almost perfectly well.
2012-03-10T09:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	hehe, you learn little bits like that as you go
2012-03-11T05:39:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Would purging ppa remove all of them or just what you want?
2012-03-11T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	alternate can be used to upgrade offline and installs a desktop OS via text mode, live CD installs in GUI mode
2012-03-11T05:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	no, just use the desktop one
2012-03-11T05:54:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Any idea why my laptop and my desktop look very different then?
2012-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	different desktop environment and/or window manager
2012-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I haven't really noticed it on the main OS but for the login screen it's very different and I can't figure out why.
2012-03-11T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	are they the same release?
2012-03-11T05:56:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Yep. Both 11.10 64 bit
2012-03-11T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	and both using the gnome defaults with Unity and whatnot? or is one xubuntu or lubuntu etc?
2012-03-11T05:57:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	both on Unity
2012-03-11T05:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	are they both clean installs?
2012-03-11T06:00:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Yeah. I'm new to Ubuntu that I wasn't around before 11.10
2012-04-01T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	you will mount the partition. If you run:  sudo fdisk -l   do you see the partition?
2012-04-01T18:15:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	I think it's listed.
2012-04-01T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	any, wine doesn't care as long as the data has appropriate access for the app to run
2012-04-01T19:05:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	escott: Is there any file system that works better or worse?
2012-04-01T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	not really, no. The default Ext4 will be fine
2012-04-01T19:06:00.000Z	Lirth	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2012-07-24T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lirth	with pulse, I believe so but I have no idea how
