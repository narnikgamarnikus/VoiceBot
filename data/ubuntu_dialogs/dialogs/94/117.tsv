2005-06-11T13:58:00.000Z	Chislon		hi
2005-06-11T13:59:00.000Z	Chislon		i am running ubuntu from the live CD, my first experience with linux...
2005-06-11T14:01:00.000Z	Chislon		nux seems really complicated though, so i wasnt going to do it, but then i talked to the people in #python and if i need it for programming then i want it, and it will be good cuz then ill learn it and stuff as it sounds good, just not great that it cant run windwos games ; )
2005-06-11T14:03:00.000Z	Chislon		i dont know what to do now...
2005-06-11T14:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	if you want to learn to program, having linux and windows is probably a good idea
2005-06-11T14:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	have you read the python tutorial?
2005-06-11T14:05:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	no not yet, and so ill need windows also for programming? do you agree with starting with python? i mostly want to be able to program games really, also want to do animations, so want to do blender, and also i think ill get flash... which another reason i wasnt going to do linux is because if im working in flash, that only works in windows, but i guess crossover works it, but im not going to pay money for crossover...
2005-06-11T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	python is a very good first programming language
2005-06-11T14:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	there is a good introductory book calling 'thinking like a computer scientist in python'
2005-06-11T14:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/
2005-06-11T14:07:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	thank you
2005-06-11T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	it's worth noting that ubuntu has python already installed, and that ubuntu (or at least mark shuttleworth) has a pro-python bias
2005-06-11T14:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	it might take a little while to get used to the ubuntu desktop, and to setup your hardware, but it's supposed to be easy ;)
2005-06-11T14:08:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	thats kool, though i know nothing about it or what that means.... that looks like its just techinical stuff which i should read, but are there tutorials that actually take you through starting to do programs and stuff like actual ones rather hten just explaining stuff?
2005-06-11T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	go to the first example in http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/chap01.htm
2005-06-11T14:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	the live cd should have enough to get by with, i guess. not sure what editor it comes with
2005-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	it's not identical, but you shouldn't have any problems with ubuntu's desktop
2005-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	not sure what you mean, so i dont wnat to fully install ubuntu?
2005-06-11T14:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	you mentioned the live cd
2005-06-11T14:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	the live cd is a 'don't install' option
2005-06-11T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	to be honest, if you goal is to learn python, maybe you should focus on that. python works perfectly well on windows
2005-06-11T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	and most of the more popular editors (emacs/vim/what have you) work on windows too
2005-06-11T14:14:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	but i was told that they are not free in windows
2005-06-11T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	and the python games framework (pygame) works on both windows / linux
2005-06-11T14:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	windows is non-free. python is free
2005-06-11T14:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	if nothing else, by developing on both systems, you will gain a greater understanding of each
2005-06-11T14:20:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	what exactly are you saying is supposed to be easy?
2005-06-11T14:21:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	oh ok..
2005-06-11T14:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	you can probably find more about the free software philosophy at www.fsf.org
2005-06-11T14:26:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	i think i read that, free as in freedom of speech, right, not neccesarily free in price
2005-06-11T14:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	something like that
2005-06-11T14:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	look under system -> preferences -> themes
2005-06-11T14:28:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	thanks, will that allow me to change the default ubuntu log in screen adn such
2005-06-11T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	no, that's system -> administration -> login screen setup
2005-06-11T14:29:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	so much to figure out, ill have to figure out the differences, i take it this is gnome im on now?
2005-06-11T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	the 'standard' ubuntu desktop is gnome, so probably yes
2005-06-11T14:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	try googling for linux and your laptop model, or ubutun and your laptop model
2005-06-11T14:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	if the printer is connected elsewhere, you'll need to setup samba; that shouldn't be too hard if you're on a home network
2005-06-11T14:32:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	i went to something like linux laptop and it basically said that slackware and fedora 3 work, someone sent me a link in python room to some guy who had a 1066 and it worked for him but he had to do a bunch of stuff i have no idea about and cant do...
2005-06-11T14:33:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	ok kool
2005-06-11T14:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	maybe it's a font thing. i haven't noticed
2005-06-11T14:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	i think it's tweakable
2005-06-11T14:38:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	ok kool
2005-06-11T14:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	no
2005-06-11T14:39:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	oh
2005-06-11T14:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	yeah, i'd go with hoary.
2005-06-11T14:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	/etc is just a directory which contains config files
2005-06-11T14:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	you can tweak boot options by editing a file called /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-06-11T14:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	presumably that is what the refers to
2005-06-11T14:56:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	but i dont know how to do that so if thats a problem how do i fix it?
2005-06-11T14:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	how about don't worry about it until you get random freezes ;)
2005-06-11T14:57:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	i dunno, and why dont i want FreeBSD
2005-06-11T14:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	maybe you do ;) i've never used freebsd
2005-06-11T15:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	it might think your clock is utc (greenwich time) instead of 'local time'
2005-06-11T15:28:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	reka, ok thank you
2005-06-12T14:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	how big's your hard drive?
2005-06-12T14:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	i guess it'll work. i'd probably have bigger linux / win xp partitions and a smallish fat32 partition for transferring data
2005-06-12T14:03:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	oh so youd just do a small transfering one?
2005-06-12T14:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	yeah
2005-06-12T14:03:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	instead of just storing all the files in one spot
2005-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	bear in mind that linux can *read* ntfs with no problem
2005-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	what are hte benefits of that over just the OS's in a partition
2005-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	oh i see.., but still what is the pros or cons between putting just the os's on their own partition and all the files on one?
2005-06-12T14:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	so you could, e.g., store all your mp3's on ntfs, as long as you don't need to write any there from linux
2005-06-12T14:05:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	ok... i dunno, like if all goes as i think it will ill basically just be using windows for games
2005-06-12T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	well, fat32 doesn't (as far as i know) support linux permissions
2005-06-12T14:05:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	i dont know what that means
2005-06-12T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	also bear in mind that fat32 is not as reliable (as far as i know, again ;) as ntfs / ext3
2005-06-12T14:05:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	LinuxJones , ok... well so how much sharing space should i do then?
2005-06-12T14:06:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	LinuxJones , is 1 gig good for swap partititon? how much space for boot partition thing? i have 736 ram
2005-06-12T14:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	i dunno. a few gig. what sort of data do you plan to share between the os's?
2005-06-12T14:06:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	i have no idea...
2005-06-12T14:07:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	im just trying to dual boot because im not ready to give up windows, and want it for games... but it sounds like i should if possible, adn that it should be possible, to do everything else on linux
2005-06-12T14:07:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	but if i get StudioMX then i might want to transfer that kind of stuff between os's.. not really sure
2005-06-12T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	well, what you *can* do is have several large partitions, giving you flexibility in the future
2005-06-12T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	20 gigs is a quite a lot of data, unless you're editing movies or doing some other specialized work
2005-06-12T14:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	don't worry too much about it. 10GB ntfs, 10GB ubuntu, and leave the rest as whatever your need
2005-06-12T14:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	i don't think you need to worry about a boot partition
2005-06-12T14:11:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	well what would i need it for lol... and oh ok
2005-06-12T14:11:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	say to backup your data when you install a hoary upgrade
2005-06-12T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	or whatever. flexibility is useful, and is all you can do if your specification is as yet unfixed
2005-06-12T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	no, i do not think that is best
2005-06-12T14:13:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	ok what are the cons of that and the pros of doing it otherwise
2005-06-12T14:13:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	i didnt know that figure out the partitions was all like this, i thought i could just run the ubuntu install and stuff heh heh
2005-06-12T14:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	please read my (and others ;) previous message regarding this. we are going in circles
2005-06-12T14:13:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	you nor anyoene else, listed pros or cons
2005-06-12T14:13:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	all you did was say that you thought i didnt need that much space and such
2005-06-12T14:14:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	you said that i can read nfts from linux
2005-06-12T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	fat32 = somewhat unreliable, does not support linux permissions; i.e., integration with linux is not perfect.
2005-06-12T14:14:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	you never said that fat32 would make both os's slower or what not, oh and u did say something about the permisions, right... ok sorry, and sorry for being a jerk... its just i dont know what most of it means, sorry
2005-06-12T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	ntfs, ext3 = reliable, and are 'native' to their respective OS's
2005-06-12T14:14:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	sorry for being a jerk, i forgot about that, so sorry
2005-06-12T14:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Chislon	what is best for you depends on your requirements ;) not on our opinions
2005-06-12T14:16:00.000Z	Chislon	HappyFool	but i can use your opinions and reasons for them to help figure out what best fits my requirments
