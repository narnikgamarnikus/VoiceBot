2009-05-15T15:42:00.000Z	MaxTesla		How do I install ATi graphic card drivers in Ubuntu 9.04 without getting the black screen of death at reboot
2009-05-15T15:42:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	make sure you install the right drivers?
2009-05-15T15:43:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	I have tried so many different drivers everything gives me the black screen of death
2009-05-15T15:45:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	you use System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2009-05-15T15:46:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	it does not show my graphic drivers ubuntu can not find anything there except my modem card
2009-05-15T15:46:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	then there are no drivers for your card, they are already installed
2009-05-15T15:46:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	NO because i had nice graphics in windows vista but now it is all pixly
2009-05-15T15:47:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	what graphics card?
2009-05-15T15:47:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	i have Ati Mobility Radeon X2300 HD
2009-05-15T15:48:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	you might find that the fglrx driver has dropped support for that card and you can only use the opensource radeon or radeonhd drivers now
2009-05-15T15:49:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	when i follow "READEON" instructions it gives me the black screen of death nad READEONHD instructions are not clear but at reboot it says i must select drivers
2009-05-15T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	okay, you need the radeonhd drivers
2009-05-15T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	please pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2009-05-15T16:14:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	wonderful
2009-05-15T16:15:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	it does work kinda it gave me more screen resolution options but now my monitor which i have connected to my laptop is a bit off and all videos are still very pixly
2009-05-15T16:16:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	great
2009-05-15T16:16:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	no not great my monitor is now way to the left and still the graphic card is not working even close to what it was under windows
2009-05-15T16:17:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	how large is this monitor and at what resolution?
2009-05-15T16:17:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	and what do you mean by "pixly videos"
2009-05-15T16:17:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	forget about the monitor i can adjust that by going into the monitor options by clicking on it
2009-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	what is 100% important is to get smoth videos
2009-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	what i want are smoth videos where the camera can keep up and everything is not a big pixle
2009-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	okay, well unfortunately I have no idea what you mean by "pixly video"
2009-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	can you take a screenshot?
2009-05-15T16:19:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	what i mean is that when the video moves everything gets messy and you can see the pixles the smal squares you can see them it is not as smoth as when you watch tv
2009-05-15T16:19:00.000Z	MaxTesla	ziroday	sure if you tell me how
2009-05-15T16:19:00.000Z	ziroday	MaxTesla	err okay, in a terminal please do metacity --replace
