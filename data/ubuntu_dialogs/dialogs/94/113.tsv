2005-09-24T10:57:00.000Z	angry_games		ok, i think it updated my Synaptic packages...where am I going from here?
2005-09-24T10:59:00.000Z	angry_games		i see fglrx-control and fglrx-kernel-source in the "all packages" list
2005-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	angry_games		i just want to enable 3d acceleration on this 9800XT 256MB AGP card
2005-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	angry_games		it would run the glxgears and the other glxgears thing, but wouldnt run a real openGL application like Enemy Territory
2005-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	angry_games		it just shuts back to the desktop
2005-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	angry_games		as far as he knows
2005-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	angry_games		i guess i have to use a 'sudo' before that right
2005-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	angry_games		E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2005-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	angry_games		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2005-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	running synaptic somewhere/
2005-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	having issues installing the driver?
2005-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	^$@$@# ATI drivers wont give me openGL 3d acceleration lol
2005-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	I'll help.
2005-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	do "sudo lsmod | grep radeon"
2005-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	it is much appreciated! (I know NOTHING about linux)
2005-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	I figured. don't worry.
2005-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	and have you installed the fglrx drivers?
2005-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	did you install the fglrx drivers?
2005-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	type "sudo modprobe fglrx"
2005-09-24T11:16:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	probably not. I bet I can get you up and running in under 10 minutes.
2005-09-24T11:16:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	heh. type "sudo lsmod | grep fglrx"
2005-09-24T11:17:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	wh00t.
2005-09-24T11:17:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	it's loaded.
2005-09-24T11:17:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	now, for the harder part.
2005-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	type "sudo vim /etc/modules"
2005-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	press "a" to add text
2005-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	and go to the bottom and add "fglrx" to the list
2005-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	then type ":wq" to save.
2005-09-24T11:19:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	if I went to fast, lemme know. I'll repeat. :)
2005-09-24T11:19:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	remove one of the fglrx's
2005-09-24T11:20:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	either press a to go into edit mode, or press "dd" while on the line
2005-09-24T11:20:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	if it messed up, just type esc, then :q!
2005-09-24T11:20:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	I shouldn't have made you use vim, it's not for newbies. :)
2005-09-24T11:22:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	bah. don't worry.
2005-09-24T11:22:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	are you at a command prompt?
2005-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	okay. then type "sudo nano /etc/modules"
2005-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	that'll shut it up. :)
2005-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	then remove the second fglrx line.
2005-09-24T11:23:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	just go down to it and delete it. :)
2005-09-24T11:24:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	arrow keys are your friend. :)
2005-09-24T11:24:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	then once the line is removed, type Ctrl-X, Y, enter
2005-09-24T11:25:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	yay.
2005-09-24T11:25:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	now, for the hard part.
2005-09-24T11:25:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	this next part is fairly easy.
2005-09-24T11:25:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	just a little complicated.
2005-09-24T11:26:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	type "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2005-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	okay.
2005-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	type "sudo fglrxconfig"
2005-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	and go through the configurator.
2005-09-24T11:27:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	it's a little daunting, but nothing too bad.
2005-09-24T11:28:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	if you have issues, just ask.
2005-09-24T11:28:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	well, it's not too hard.
2005-09-24T11:28:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	you have PS2/USB mouse
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	pick any mouse model? (it doesnt list me exact one)
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	hold on.
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	don't emulate 3 buttons
2005-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	ok....quad buffer stereo?
2005-09-24T11:30:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	not really important.
2005-09-24T11:30:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	 single head (since i only using a single monitor)
2005-09-24T11:30:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	yep.
2005-09-24T11:31:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	ok now it wants monitor info...i searched where it said to search earlier but to no avail...just use generic/defaults?
2005-09-24T11:31:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	hold on.
2005-09-24T11:32:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	you could simply not customize the refresh rate.
2005-09-24T11:32:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	cos then Xorg will autodetect crap.
2005-09-24T11:32:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	then you just log in with an insanely high resolution, and tweak. :)
2005-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	ok, please specify which restriction scheme you want to implement
2005-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	accept the defaults.
2005-09-24T11:34:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	for the most part, you can accept the defaults for the rest of this.
2005-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	if it defaults to yes, then yes. if not, then no.
2005-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	like I said, you can accept the defaults from here on.
2005-09-24T11:36:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	which is pretty much just pressing enter a lot. :)
2005-09-24T11:37:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	pretty much.
2005-09-24T11:38:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	ooook...back to a command prompt
2005-09-24T11:38:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	works?
2005-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	screw fglrxinfo
2005-09-24T11:44:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	glxinfo | grep vendor
2005-09-24T11:45:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	is this the fglrx driver from hoary or breezy?
2005-09-24T11:45:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	are you running hoary or breezy?
2005-09-24T11:45:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	crap. my fault then. you're running xfree86. :)
2005-09-24T11:45:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	you didn't need to save to xorg.conf
2005-09-24T11:46:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	let's see.
2005-09-24T11:46:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	just re-run fglrxconfig
2005-09-24T11:46:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	and save to the default name. :)
2005-09-24T11:46:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	sorry about that. :)
2005-09-24T11:48:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	yup.
2005-09-24T11:49:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	most likely. :)
2005-09-24T11:50:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-09-24T11:57:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	well...that didn't really work out too well
2005-09-24T11:57:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	howssat?
2005-09-24T12:01:00.000Z	angry_games	mushroomblue	you going to be here a bit?
2005-09-24T12:01:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	did you restart the machine?
2005-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	mushroomblue	angry_games	cos you might want to try that first.
