2011-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	nm-applet --replace?
2011-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	An instance of nm-applet is already running.
2011-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	ok, try first iwlist wlan0 scanning
2011-01-11T10:32:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	wlan0     Failed to read scan data : Network is down, also the network tray app says wifi is disabled
2011-01-11T10:33:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	ok, killall nm-applet && gnome-panel --replace
2011-01-11T10:33:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	otherwise use rfkill
2011-01-11T10:33:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	ok did that
2011-01-11T10:34:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	Does your applet is visible?
2011-01-11T10:34:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	the terminal was sitting on the process not completing it. i closed terminal and the tray disappeared..
2011-01-11T10:35:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	Alt-F2 gnome-panel --replace
2011-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	alt+F2 does nothing
2011-01-11T10:36:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	i assume your whole panel is gone
2011-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	yes
2011-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	Alt-Ctrl-t can you open terminal?
2011-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	yes terminal is open
2011-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	gnome-panel --replace, do not close it yet
2011-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	ok done
2011-01-11T10:39:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	you have panel now?
2011-01-11T10:39:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	yes
2011-01-11T10:39:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	do you see nm-applet?
2011-01-11T10:39:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	not in the tray
2011-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	where?
2011-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	sorry i should have been clearer. there i sno nm-applet
2011-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	ok, lets fix panel: Alt-F2 gnome-panel --replace
2011-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	it should free terminal
2011-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	ok
2011-01-11T10:42:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	in terminal: killall nm-applet
2011-01-11T10:42:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	no process found
2011-01-11T10:43:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	ok, install rfkill, and run rfkill list
2011-01-11T10:43:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	i need to test own nm-applet
2011-01-11T10:44:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	What applet you do have? Did you try to add it back to panel?
2011-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	i tried to run rfkill -list
2011-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	and it wants a identifier?
2011-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	rfkill list
2011-01-11T10:46:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	0: hp-wifi: Wireless LAN  Soft blocked: yes  Hard blocked: yes 1: phy0: Wireless LAN  Soft blocked: yes  Hard blocked: yes
2011-01-11T10:46:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	back to applets, right click on panel and - add to panel
2011-01-11T10:47:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	and maybe xangua was right?
2011-01-11T10:48:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	ok i put in gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/panel && killall gnome-panel
2011-01-11T10:48:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	and it killed the panel nothing came back
2011-01-11T10:49:00.000Z	shcherbak	desaints	same trick like last time, terminal to replace panel and Alt-F2 to free terminal
2011-01-11T10:51:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	ok i have everything back up and running, nm-applet is back also
2011-01-11T10:51:00.000Z	desaints	shcherbak	still says wifi is disabled
