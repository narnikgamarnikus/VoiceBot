2009-03-19T05:12:00.000Z	killindillin		thus freeing stuff up
2009-03-19T05:12:00.000Z	killindillin		??
2009-03-19T05:14:00.000Z	killindillin		sebsebseb:i know what u mean but what is swap
2009-03-19T05:15:00.000Z	killindillin		no i was goin to try knoppix first
2009-03-19T05:15:00.000Z	killindillin		see if i like linux
2009-03-19T05:16:00.000Z	killindillin		i probly will like it because linux is half command promt and half desktop....right??
2009-03-19T05:16:00.000Z	killindillin		ya i know bout knoppix j
2009-03-19T05:17:00.000Z	killindillin		k*
2009-03-19T05:17:00.000Z	killindillin		ya like msdos and half xp right???
2009-03-19T05:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	or a mixture of both
2009-03-19T04:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	you can
2009-03-19T04:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	I guess you just install it on the external hard disk like you would for an internal
2009-03-19T04:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	having a seperate home for an Ubuntu install is a great idea by the way.   don't make your root / partition massive either.  so like 10 to 16GB should be fine.   and 1GB or so swap  is good
2009-03-19T04:34:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	thanx for the info
2009-03-19T04:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	why external?
2009-03-19T04:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	oh right well  a  / with home inside it.  a lot can be done with 10GB  Ubuntu
2009-03-19T04:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	well  woudn't normalley recommend it, but wubi
2009-03-19T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	normalley it's better to partition a hard disk for real,  and yes it works with VIsrta
2009-03-19T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	it puts Ubuntu inside your  VIsta partition
2009-03-19T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	and then you get the Windows bootloader and Grub
2009-03-19T04:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	how much RAM in Vista,  because  good for trying, but I woudn't recommend it for long time proper usage, but you can run Ubuntu inside VIsta, if you got enough RAM
2009-03-19T04:38:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	i have 1 gig of ram
2009-03-19T04:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yep Ubuntu should work in a virtual machine in Vista,  but Vista as the host hummmm
2009-03-19T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	or you won't have USB  suppourt
2009-03-19T04:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	so the closed version instead of open source yeah.   http://www.virtualbox.org
2009-03-19T04:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	now as I said wubi and virtualbox  will be good for trying Ubuntu, but then really you should partition a hard disk for real later on for Ubuntu :)
2009-03-19T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	of course
2009-03-19T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	it will run any OS for the PC, well not sure about Hackintosh :D
2009-03-19T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yes, and maybe you don't really need Vista
2009-03-19T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	why?
2009-03-19T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	ok well I expect a bit more free space can be made, and you can dual boot on that hard disk
2009-03-19T04:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	maybe put on the external then.   altough  being able to run two OS's at the same time is pretty damn sweet so yeah virtual machine.
2009-03-19T04:46:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	thank you but how big a usb drive i need to run ubuntu
2009-03-19T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	Flash Stick or external hard disk?
2009-03-19T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	a default install of Ubuntu takes up about 1GB
2009-03-19T04:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	4GB flash drive perfect
2009-03-19T04:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	,but you can't have all the  rather good Linux stuff
2009-03-19T04:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	no point bother with Kubuntu as well for example, since the lack of space
2009-03-19T04:49:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	: like what?
2009-03-19T04:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	I think   a  dynamically expanding  Virtualbox VM is a good idea
2009-03-19T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	it won't take up that much space on your hard disk,  unless you start putting loads of big data in to it
2009-03-19T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yeah Linux programs take up hardly any space, unlike Windows programs
2009-03-19T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yep you can do it all on that
2009-03-19T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	to be honest I don't like KDE4 that much, which is the only KDE in 8.10  hardy heron has  KDE3 and 4 as options :)  KDE 3 :d
2009-03-19T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	8.04 is long term suppourt also.  and not that much difference between 8.10 and 8.04.   with the next Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Xubuntu at the end of April.  have you had Ubuntu installed before?   well you have the  options now.  so  do what you you want to do,  and that can be for trying.  Then you could do a more proper  long term install once Jaunty is out.   That's my suggestion.
2009-03-19T05:00:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	i maybe can do that but with a longterm installation do mean i take virtual box and just be able to run two oses at the same time or dual boot
2009-03-19T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	I mean use 8.10 for trying things
2009-03-19T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	then do 9.04  for a real proper long term install
2009-03-19T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	and I assume by the time that's released Ext4 will be good enough to use as the file system instead of Ext3
2009-03-19T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	I mean long term, the one you don't re install. the one you just upgrade to  newer versions
2009-03-19T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	Vista as the host hummmmm.   really it should be the other way round, but I don't think that's possible with only 1GB RAM
2009-03-19T05:03:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	oh you mean a dual boot right and i just update the os like vista right.
2009-03-19T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	the host OS the one that is on the hard disk for real.  and the guest the one that is in the vm
2009-03-19T05:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	a proper partitioned dual boot  would be good once 9.04 is out.  and also with Ext4 as the file system instead of Ext3, if it is indeed stable enough by then.
2009-03-19T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	Wubi or  virtual machines of Ubuntu,  are good for trying,  but  for a proper install   it's best to partition the hard disk for real
2009-03-19T05:06:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	okay i get you now i can run the currant ubuntu off a thumb drive then when the new one comes out i partition and all that stuff???....right
2009-03-19T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yes
2009-03-19T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	once 9.04 is out,  put it on the hard disk properly
2009-03-19T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	also I expect OS's run quicker from the internal hard disk
2009-03-19T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	you shoudn't use your internal hard disk as the major storage device, and so you should have data on extenral hard disk.  and both even for data you want to make sure to never lose
2009-03-19T05:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	virtual machines are pretty  damn interesting, and so for trying Ubuntu for your first time with 8.10,   even though Vista is the host,  I would recommend doing Ubuntu like that.     if Vista was the guest,  you could just copy it  like a normal OS file.  and delete it like one as well.  so if a virus for example, just use a clean backup copy
2009-03-19T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	I am saying you can make some more space, by  moving data off your internal hard disk yeah
2009-03-19T05:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	Ubuntu  can be  GUI GUI GUI GUI,  or it can be comands commands commands commands
2009-03-19T05:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	altough it depends what kind of data you have really, because if you only got  small files
2009-03-19T05:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	well  for a dual boot.  you need to make your self.  well  you do the maths :D   ,but  the  Ubuntu / partition should be like 16GB.    a 1GB swap partition.  and a seperate home partition that is a few GB's or more.
2009-03-19T05:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	you don't even know what I mean by those yet?
2009-03-19T05:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	/ is  where Ubuntu and all it's programs go
2009-03-19T05:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	swap is virtual memory,  hard disk space, that it will use as if it were RAM, if it's needed
2009-03-19T05:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	have you tried Ubuntu from the Live CD or something already?
2009-03-19T05:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	you run the ISO's of Live CD's inside Virtualbox instead of burning to CD, by the way
2009-03-19T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	Knoppix is a nice Live CD distro, but  for  a proper distro  Ubuntu is a great one
2009-03-19T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	that depends on the distro, but yes  the shell (terminal) is very powerful  in Linux
2009-03-19T05:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	other distros, are mainly about commands
2009-03-19T05:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	we got  newbie friendly  distros,  where  they have graphical installers and  nice graphical programs.   then  text based installer distros with  a lot of commandline as well.
2009-03-19T05:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	well Ubuntu calls it the terminal, but the more hardcore Linux people will call it The Shell
2009-03-19T05:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	software is much quicker to install  in Ubuntu with commands, but  there is also a rather nice  Synaptic Package Manager which is graphical
2009-03-19T05:21:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	i know that...but i'm a linux noob....and a windows geek...so explain it to me as a noob
2009-03-19T05:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	 think of add or remove programs in Windows.  Now imagine if you could search for programs in it that you wanted to install.   Then were able to just  say that you wanted to install them, and it downloaded and installed it for you.   There it was on the menu,   you didn't have to run an installer.   Well that's what you get with Synaptic Package Manager.
2009-03-19T05:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	the terminal for example:  sudo apt-get install  programname  and  it just downloads it off the server and installs it for you,  and there it is in the menu.  ,but menus?   you don't need a menu to open programs,  just  put the name of it in the terminal  press enter and it opens
2009-03-19T05:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yep thousands of packages (programs are called packages in Linux)  you can get just like that
2009-03-19T05:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	websites lol,  only for stuff that isn't in the repo,  but not much of that you will want to run anyway
2009-03-19T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	yes and did you read it or someone tell you?  no viruses or spyware or  any of that either.  well they can make for LInux, but you have to know what your doing  to instal it.  or  have no firewall. and a really bad  password
2009-03-19T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	ever been in the Windows registry messing around?    how boring and tedicious yes?
2009-03-19T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	home is like  a cross between,  my documents, program files,   and the windows registry, but done right  as user data files for programs in  hidden .folders
2009-03-19T05:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	so let's say your using Firefox and your profile has gone wrong.  you could just delete the .mozilla folder and  it would be like you had a clean install  again of Firefox
2009-03-19T06:33:00.000Z	killindillin	sebsebseb	i'm back
2009-03-19T06:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	ok
2009-03-19T06:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	what about it?
2009-03-19T06:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	stargazer looks like I am not picking up on what your trying to say
2009-03-19T06:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	I am here
2009-03-19T06:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	md5sum the ISO first
2009-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	whatever to that guy, and let's get you setu
2009-03-19T06:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	killindillin	pm if you don't want to chat here
