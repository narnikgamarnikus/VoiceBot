2005-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	_jason	marky	follow the instructions ubotu sent you and you will be all set :)
2005-12-17T17:49:00.000Z	_jason	marky	gksudo nautilus
2005-12-17T17:49:00.000Z	_jason	marky	did the wikipedia thing not work?
2005-12-17T17:49:00.000Z	_jason	marky	gah ubuntu wiki i mean
2006-03-21T17:59:00.000Z	_jason	marky	are you trying to install w32codecs?
2006-03-21T17:59:00.000Z	marky	_jason	yes
2006-03-21T06:03:00.000Z	marky	_jason	, you da man  , i think there installed :D . what do you rekon is the best player? mplayer or vlc?
2006-03-21T06:04:00.000Z	_jason	marky	I like mplayer
2006-03-21T06:04:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i shall look that way then   , thanks for your time
2006-03-21T06:05:00.000Z	_jason	marky	it's easy to try both mplayer and vlc though since they are both in the repos.  Just enable universe and multiverse
2006-03-21T06:07:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i can't seem to play wmv's in vlc or in mpplayer, it said somethink like type font face or something
2006-03-21T06:08:00.000Z	_jason	marky	install the mplayer-fonts package for the font problem and install w32codecs (bot will give you a link) for wmv's
2006-03-21T06:08:00.000Z	marky	_jason	thanks
2006-03-21T06:13:00.000Z	marky	_jason	the font problem is now fixed but when mplayer pops up it just says "no media opened" even when i said "open with"
2006-03-21T06:14:00.000Z	_jason	marky	if you try to open the file after running mplayer, does it work?
2006-03-21T06:14:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i'll try
2006-03-21T06:15:00.000Z	marky	_jason	the wmv i'm trying to play is on a xp machine on my network , i can see the file and proberbly copy to my hd but i wan na stream it any ideas?
2006-03-21T06:16:00.000Z	_jason	marky	no experience with that sorry
2006-03-21T06:18:00.000Z	marky	_jason	when i copied the wmv to my desktop it worked in mplayer but jst not over the network
2006-03-21T06:39:00.000Z	marky	_jason	its wierd now i got totem working, it does everything mp3s etc wmv over the network, but xmms wont stream mp3s and vlc or mplayer doesn't stream wmv or mpeg etc
2006-03-21T07:32:00.000Z	marky	_jason	still now streaming video from anywhere even www
2006-03-21T07:33:00.000Z	_jason	marky	well I know www should be working, do you get any errors if you try to do it from a terminal?
2006-03-21T07:34:00.000Z	marky	_jason	when say i open a firefox page that has a movie embeded in it  , it says "no picture"
2006-03-21T07:34:00.000Z	_jason	marky	did you install mozilla-mplayer?
2006-03-21T07:35:00.000Z	_jason	marky	ok, now for the important part.  Is firefox actually using mplayer?  :) (check in about:plugins).  What do you mean by ``where is run?''
2006-03-21T07:35:00.000Z	_jason	marky	accessories > terminal, or alt+f2
2006-03-21T07:37:00.000Z	marky	_jason	can't see a plugins in about in firefox
2006-03-21T07:38:00.000Z	_jason	marky	type 'about:plugins' in the address bar
2006-03-21T07:38:00.000Z	marky	_jason	it says mplayerplug-in 3.05
2006-03-21T07:39:00.000Z	_jason	marky	for everything?
2006-03-21T07:39:00.000Z	marky	_jason	so yes
2006-03-21T07:39:00.000Z	_jason	marky	does it have any totem stuff in there?
2006-03-21T07:40:00.000Z	_jason	marky	issue the command ubotu sent you and restart firefox.  See if it works then
2006-03-21T07:40:00.000Z	marky	_jason	ok
2006-03-21T07:41:00.000Z	marky	_jason	its gone out of the plugin list  , i'll give it a go on www
2006-03-21T07:42:00.000Z	marky	_jason	nope  , i can hear it ,but not see it,, it says "no picture"
2006-03-21T07:42:00.000Z	_jason	marky	link?
2006-03-21T07:43:00.000Z	marky	_jason	http://www.ugoto.com/videos/
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	marky	_jason	would the vlc plugin annoy the mplayer plugin
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	_jason	marky	heh I just saw the teacher get his pants pulled down.  Umm.. put 'ls /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/' on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ please
2006-03-21T07:45:00.000Z	marky	_jason	see it?
2006-03-21T07:46:00.000Z	_jason	marky	yep, for future reference it's easier if you just paste the link here
2006-03-21T07:46:00.000Z	_jason	marky	I would remove the vlcplugin
2006-03-21T07:46:00.000Z	_jason	marky	yeah
2006-03-21T07:46:00.000Z	marky	_jason	ok  , sorry jason
2006-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i'll give it a go
2006-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	_jason	marky	if you used apt, I think the package is mozilla-plugin-vlc
2006-03-21T07:49:00.000Z	marky	_jason	it worked i can see it YIPPIE, right i'm gonna try over network
2006-03-21T07:49:00.000Z	_jason	marky	great
2006-03-21T07:51:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i installed some samba stuff while i was playing about trying to fix this prob  , now i can't browse my network !!!joy lol
2006-03-21T07:59:00.000Z	marky	_jason	 right, i can play vids in firefox now but still not from another machine
2006-03-21T08:11:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i just removed totem to see if it would help but now i have nothing that will play it
2006-03-21T08:11:00.000Z	_jason	marky	try totem-xine
2006-03-21T08:12:00.000Z	marky	_jason	xmms won't play the mp3 on the same place, i can copy and paste it to my hd then it works :S
2006-03-21T08:15:00.000Z	marky	_jason	have you quit?
2006-03-21T08:15:00.000Z	_jason	marky	you've been asking for a while, maybe you should try the forums and/or mailing list?
2006-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	marky	_jason	should i just reinstall it?
2006-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	_jason	marky	totem?
2006-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	marky	_jason	the whole of ubuntu
2006-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	_jason	marky	I wouldn't
2006-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i not cleaver enuff to find the answers i need  , in linux its all called something different, i'm useless
2006-03-21T08:22:00.000Z	_jason	marky	you should try posting on the forums and mailing the mailing list before a reinstall imo
2006-03-21T08:22:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i think i'll reinstall ubuntu then only get mplayer not all loads of syuff
2006-03-21T08:22:00.000Z	_jason	marky	installing stuff from apt should not bork your system
2006-03-21T08:23:00.000Z	marky	_jason	i've only been using the synaptic package manager
2006-03-21T08:23:00.000Z	marky	_jason	whats bork
2006-03-21T08:25:00.000Z	_jason	marky	good luck

2006-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	marky	_jason	how do i do that?
2006-03-21T09:11:00.000Z	_jason	marky	reboot in 'recovery mode' and run 'passwd your_username'
2006-03-21T09:11:00.000Z	marky	_jason	nah, my nickserv password
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	_jason	marky	oh, I believe there is some way to do it if you set up an email for the account.  You may want to ask in #freenode
2006-03-21T09:12:00.000Z	marky	_jason	, now i remebr before you asked ubotu to tell me about wmvs can you do it again so i can get the codecs?
2006-03-21T09:13:00.000Z	_jason	marky	and for totem to use them you need to install totem-xine by the way
2006-03-21T09:14:00.000Z	marky	_jason	now this is a clean install i was gonna get the codecs then get mplayer
2006-03-21T09:30:00.000Z	marky	_jason	can you tell me that think about replacing totem in firefox again please?
