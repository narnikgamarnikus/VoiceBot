2010-05-27T20:11:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	maybe you're having a framebuffer thing
2010-05-27T20:12:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i'm checking it out but could someone tell me if grub is supossed to show up? its the only os installed so then it won't show no?
2010-05-27T20:13:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	I am not sure. Personally I always am careful to have grub and also to have a 10 secs countdown. Apart from the fact that I use debian.
2010-05-27T20:14:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	uhu... but it's a clean install, couldn't choose anything or so
2010-05-27T20:33:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	hmmz uses grub1 still
2010-05-27T20:14:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	but what happens when you press:  ALT+F2 (or try CTRL+ALT+F2   in case you use X )
2010-05-27T20:14:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	nothing :) i tried switching other terminal
2010-05-27T20:15:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	and you're sure you don't have X ?
2010-05-27T20:15:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	pretty sure... why would he install it? i asked only for ssh
2010-05-27T20:15:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i'm in now, i pulled out my graphics card, the mobo had integrated gpu too, now it works!
2010-05-27T20:16:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	most probably your graphic card doesn't like the framebufer device
2010-05-27T20:17:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	how can i correct that then? i don't want to blacklist it...i want to use the graphics card
2010-05-27T20:17:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	thx for your help btw :)
2010-05-27T20:18:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	could it help if i'd install the nvidia drivers from the terminal then reinstall the graphics card and boot? how can i check if "nouveau" driver is installed?
2010-05-27T20:19:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	the framebuffer device can be disabled with no conseguences, save some prettier fonts on text mode. It won't affect the normal text mode or X. Unless, 10.04 is wired to use the framebuffer for X as an intermediary, but in my opinion, that would have been a bad thing.
2010-05-27T20:19:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	oh ok√© then i'll try to "blacklist" it like the site said but Hedegaard thinks it doesn't use one
2010-05-27T20:20:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	the font of terminal seems ugly :p not anti aliased or something
2010-05-27T20:20:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	yea yea I know what you mean  :p
2010-05-27T20:21:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	needed to be sure :p so you sugest disabling the framebuffer first and trying again? installing driver from nvidia won't help? do you know how i can be sure that x isn't installed?
2010-05-27T20:22:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	: "the program 'startx' is currently not installed.... sudo apt-get install xinit to install"
2010-05-27T20:23:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	of course. Login and give this:  sudo dpkg -l xorg*
2010-05-27T20:24:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	if you want to be minimal, don't install xinit. It will pull a lot of stuff as well.
2010-05-27T20:24:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	none found :) thats good and oke i just need my graphics card to work
2010-05-27T20:25:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	so disable the framebuffer thing and reboot and see how it goes. Then put your card and see again how it goes. These things are troubleshooted with tries and tries
2010-05-27T20:26:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i will, just searching how to disable it
2010-05-27T20:26:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	saw this?  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1484385
2010-05-27T20:28:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i should add the same line? right? blacklist vga16fb
2010-05-27T20:28:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	let me see if there is any other info. But tell me, how does the screen look like? Is it the old 80x25 or there are more characters on the screen ?
2010-05-27T20:28:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	doesn't depend on your gpu or something?
2010-05-27T20:29:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	80:25 i think, looks the same as it always does
2010-05-27T20:29:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	I'm verifying. Debian usually doesn't use framebufers so never had to bother ;)
2010-05-27T20:29:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	hehe, thx a lot!
2010-05-27T20:30:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i'll add all these: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-install-nvidia-drivers-manually-on-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html
2010-05-27T20:31:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	if you are going to use only text mode, why do you need those nvidia drivers ?
2010-05-27T20:31:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	those are for X
2010-05-27T20:32:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i'm gonna install it later :) so yes
2010-05-27T20:32:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	oh... only the vga16fb then?
2010-05-27T20:32:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	what gives:  dpkg -l grub*
2010-05-27T20:33:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	I'm not sure whether 10.04 uses grub or grub2
2010-05-27T20:35:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	retrying with the vga16fb blacklisted and gpu card
2010-05-27T20:38:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	same problem, any other ideas?
2010-05-27T20:39:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	jjust a sec. phone call
2010-05-27T20:45:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	still the same thing ?
2010-05-27T20:45:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	yup, same thing, i tried ubuntu hardy live cd to make sure it wasnt the gpu, and live cd works
2010-05-27T20:46:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	I see. And someone mentioned 10.04 uses grub2  I suppose..
2010-05-27T20:47:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	when i did dpkg -l grub* it showed a list of packages with ii in front of grub-generic and another one and 'un' in front of grub2
2010-05-27T20:47:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	I don't know grub2. But what must be checked is whether grub2 itself uses framebuffer splashscreen, and has to ve verified and seen how to disable it
2010-05-27T20:47:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i tought 'un' meant uninstalled and ii meant install
2010-05-27T20:48:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	and are you so sure its a framebuffer?
2010-05-27T20:48:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	yes the un and ii convention is as you say
2010-05-27T20:48:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	: "To keep things extra clean, I un-commented GRUB_TERMINAL=console in /etc/default/grub to prevent GRUB from starting a framebuffer, but it's not really necessary."
2010-05-27T20:48:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	if you don't have X, what else can it be?  :)
2010-05-27T20:48:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	text mode graphic corruption?  :p
2010-05-27T20:49:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	can you check what do you have in  /boot/grub/menu.lst    ?
2010-05-27T20:49:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i will sec
2010-05-27T20:50:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	you see what appears in that file  at a line similar to:        kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.26-2-686 root=/dev/hda1 ro quiet
2010-05-27T20:51:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	second i'm gonna check but have to unplug graphics card and stuff
2010-05-27T20:51:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	new problem i let the live cd boot and it gives same stripes but in color :p
2010-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	but the card worked in windows and it does display the live cd menu and selection menu's and stuff
2010-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	the 10.04 live-cd ?
2010-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	 no the 8.04 i haven't downloaded the 10.04 yet
2010-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	you have an nvidia card ?
2010-05-27T20:53:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	yes the 6800gtx and i know there are problems with the new "nouveau" driver but it isn't included in 8.04
2010-05-27T20:53:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	mouse pointer works :p
2010-05-27T20:54:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	hmm. It definitely is a driver issue. But I wonder what the hell does it have to do with text mode if it doesn't use the framebuffer
2010-05-27T20:54:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	it there a way to be 100% positive it doesn't use a framebuffer?
2010-05-27T20:55:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i'm checking if i can boot live cd in vesa mode or something
2010-05-27T20:55:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	yea. I'm checking for how to see and make sure there's no framebuffer in use
2010-05-27T20:56:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	ok thx! i selected "safe mode" in live cd boot menu... guessing that will use vesa?
2010-05-27T20:57:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	if it helps: the live cd allows me to edit the boot parameters ( it takes very long to load so irritating to retry alot... only 265mb ram )
2010-05-27T20:57:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	I suppose so. As I said, I use debian so maybe ubuntu can have it differently. But to what I remember, 8.04 didn't really use the framebuffer. Not on my laptop at least.
2010-05-27T20:58:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	ok, I don't know myself it's first time i have trouble with it
2010-05-27T20:58:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	wow, it boots perfectly in "safe mode" !
2010-05-27T21:01:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	ok. Check your menu.lst for a place that has   defoptions=
2010-05-27T21:02:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	ok sec i'm changing cards & stuff
2010-05-27T21:04:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	there you probably have:   # defoptions=quiet                    You will make it be:   # defoptions=quiet vga=nofb
2010-05-27T21:05:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	there is no menu.lst in /boot/grub
2010-05-27T21:06:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	"sudo locate menu.lst" only results an example grub-menu.lst in /doc.../examples
2010-05-27T21:08:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	what is my prob? I don't even know myself :p
2010-05-27T21:08:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	you want me to disable frame buffer then?
2010-05-27T21:08:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	good night
2010-05-27T21:09:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	yea. You don't lose anything. There must be a way to disable that using grub2 as well. I just don't know what that way is
2010-05-27T21:10:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	the boot menu that gets presented when you start up in your installation  ?
2010-05-27T21:11:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	no grub boot menu
2010-05-27T21:11:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	we are sure i have no x right? :p
2010-05-27T21:11:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	there MUST be a grub somewhere. I guess you have the timeout set at 0
2010-05-27T21:12:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	you need the help of someone who knows grub2 and see how to modify the settings. I don't know grub2
2010-05-27T21:13:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i got grub menu thx to bastid_raZor
2010-05-27T21:15:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	i can see the boot parameter in grub and edit, what should i add?
2010-05-27T21:15:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	Refering to what I know of grub1 (no idea if it still aplies to grub2):  there you probably have:   # defoptions=quiet                    You will make it be:   # defoptions=quiet vga=nofb
2010-05-27T21:16:00.000Z	Night_Elf`food	dzan	most probably you will need to update-grub   after that
2010-05-27T21:17:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	there is no line like that.... i'll search how to disable fb in grub2 you can go to sleep :p thx a lot you!
2010-05-27T21:17:00.000Z	dzan	Night_Elf`food	really thanks a lot! i'm off myself diner in my time zone :p
