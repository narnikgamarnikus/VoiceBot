2008-03-10T04:20:00.000Z	pen		when I install windows, I accidentally delete one of the partitions and thus when I boot to live cd gparted can't read any partitions
2008-03-10T04:21:00.000Z	pen		but I still can mount the old partitions and copy everything (my root / ) to a backup drive
2008-03-10T04:21:00.000Z	pen		now I use gparted to repartition the drive and copy and paste my old / from the backup drive
2008-03-10T04:22:00.000Z	pen		now when I boot up
2008-03-10T04:22:00.000Z	pen		it says something with read-only
2008-03-10T04:22:00.000Z	pen		and I can't boot into my desktop
2008-03-10T04:22:00.000Z	pen		so what should I do now?
2008-03-10T04:22:00.000Z	pen		it seems like when I copy and paste the / to the backup drive the permission changed
2008-03-10T04:22:00.000Z	pen		what should I do to reverse it?
2008-03-10T04:23:00.000Z	pen		I'm in live CD right now
2008-03-10T04:24:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	should you restore a backup rather that copy and paste
2008-03-10T04:24:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	Iwas in a hurry and I now know I'm wrong
2008-03-10T04:24:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	how was your backup made
2008-03-10T04:25:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I just copy and paste everything in the partition
2008-03-10T04:25:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	since I was in the live cd
2008-03-10T04:25:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	how was your backup made
2008-03-10T04:25:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	how was your backup made not how was it restored
2008-03-10T04:26:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I told you I copy and paste the mounted partition to my external drive
2008-03-10T04:26:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	since gparted can't read anything in my hd because the window xp installation messed up
2008-03-10T04:26:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	so how was my backup made? I copy and paste
2008-03-10T04:27:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	ok
2008-03-10T04:27:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	you overwrote a partition
2008-03-10T04:27:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	you overwrote a partition?
2008-03-10T04:27:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	what do you mean
2008-03-10T04:28:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I don't think so
2008-03-10T04:28:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	why did you have to restore bear with me
2008-03-10T04:28:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I have a external drive with format ext3 and I create a folder named my ubuntu and copy everything from the disk to it
2008-03-10T04:29:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I have to restore because the data are in the external drive
2008-03-10T04:29:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	my question now is permission
2008-03-10T04:29:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	what should I do to make everything in that partition readable and writable
2008-03-10T04:29:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	not just from the root of the live cd
2008-03-10T04:30:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	chown
2008-03-10T04:30:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	what does that do?
2008-03-10T04:31:00.000Z	DIL_		!chown | pen
2008-03-10T04:31:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	and I'm in live cd
2008-03-10T04:32:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I mean i'm in live cd how does that help to change the owner to the root inside the partition
2008-03-10T04:32:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	can you get to the terminal
2008-03-10T04:32:00.000Z	pen		ok

2008-03-10T04:33:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	cd to relavant files and ls -al
2008-03-10T04:33:00.000Z	pen		DIL_,ok

2008-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	what should I do next?
2008-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	should show permissions for files and folders for users, group, owner
2008-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	yes
2008-03-10T04:34:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I see them
2008-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	but how do I set those back to how a ubuntu system should be?
2008-03-10T04:35:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	look for file(s) you want to access and see what permission they have r=read w=write x=execute
2008-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I want everything to be rw by anyone so at least I can boot into my ubuntu
2008-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	how should I achive that?
2008-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	*achieve
2008-03-10T04:37:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	you can use the tar command tar cvf
2008-03-10T04:37:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	what does that do? tar cvf?
2008-03-10T04:39:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I still have my backup (or copy and paste) in my external, if I were to restore it again to my ubuntu partition how should I do instead of copy and paste?
2008-03-10T04:40:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	after tar cvf "somefile name" it will create an archive in a name you specify - as part of using linuz it is a basic you should learn to use
2008-03-10T04:40:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	well, that's why I'm asking. I don't think I need that
2008-03-10T04:41:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	what i am not getting is what happened to the source you copied from
2008-03-10T04:42:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	please let me explain in more detail, this should take sometime typing
2008-03-10T04:44:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	I want to install window and prepare a NTFS partition for it in gparted, but after I proceed into the blue installation screen, windows can't install it because the partition is not a valid windows partition so I use the window installation partition manager to delete the window partition I made in gparted, after that it still can't install windows so I try to boot back to my ubuntu and found out that I can't boot into it anymore
2008-03-10T04:45:00.000Z	DIL_	pen	from terminal type locate grub
2008-03-10T04:45:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	so I boot to live cd and found out that gparted can't read any partition in my hd but I can mount the partition in my computer:///
2008-03-10T04:46:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	after that I copy everything from my ubuntu partition to my external, then I delete everything and make new partition table from gparted again
2008-03-10T04:46:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	this is all done in live cd
2008-03-10T04:46:00.000Z	pen	DIL_	basically, that's the whole story
