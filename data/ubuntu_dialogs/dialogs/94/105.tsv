2006-01-20T13:30:00.000Z	lightbright		how can i wipe or totally securely format hdb?
2006-01-20T13:30:00.000Z	lightbright		ant ideas anyoner?
2006-01-20T13:30:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdb
2006-01-20T13:31:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	 what?
2006-01-20T13:31:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	just use that command, starting from the "dd" part
2006-01-20T13:31:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	/dev/urandom and /dev/null are special
2006-01-20T13:32:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	so you also recommend dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hdb ?
2006-01-20T13:34:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdb
2006-01-20T13:35:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	then make damn well sure you unplug your hda disk before using dban
2006-01-20T13:35:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	 dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdb   or   dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hdb ?
2006-01-20T13:35:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah but don't do urandom
2006-01-20T13:35:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	why?
2006-01-20T13:36:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	 ok, ill do dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdb
2006-01-20T13:37:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	 ok, ill type: dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdb
2006-01-20T13:37:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah
2006-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	minimize the number of services you run that service the world
2006-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	run a firewall
2006-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	use a router
2006-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	permanently shut down services like ssh and ftp, if you have them
2006-01-28T17:20:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	shut down ssh and ftp?
2006-01-28T17:20:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	well those aren't standard, but things like that are the biggest opening for the kinda thing you want to protect from
2006-01-28T17:20:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	how can I see if ssh and ftp is running now?
2006-01-28T17:22:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	go to administration->services
2006-01-28T17:22:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	but first and formost, install Firestarter from the repositries, and start up that
2006-01-28T17:22:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	im running firestarter now
2006-01-28T17:22:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	you don't need to use internet port scanners
2006-01-28T17:23:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	actions schedular (anacron and atd) is running in services!  is that safe?
2006-01-28T17:23:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah, those are local
2006-01-28T17:24:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	and actions schedular (cron) is running in services!  is that safe also?
2006-01-28T17:24:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	port scanning yourself from your internet IP (not the 192.168..... one) will tell you all your open ports
2006-01-28T17:24:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	just look for stuff like ftp and ssh and apache
2006-01-28T17:24:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	and the only other services running are keylogger and gdm!  is that ok?
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	none of those appear in services
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah you're fine
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	 ftp and ssh and apache is not there
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	so it looks like im ok then :)
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	do the portscan now
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	how do I do the portscan?
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	I have my ip
2006-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	the menu: Applications->System Tools->Network Tools
2006-01-28T17:26:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	then go to port scan tab, and you can figure the rest
2006-01-28T17:26:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	what IP address do I enter then?
2006-01-28T17:26:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	not the 192.168.XXX.XXX one
2006-01-28T17:26:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	if you have one of those
2006-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	that's a locla network IP, so it's not how the world sees you
2006-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	I typed /dns lightbright, is that the one I use?
2006-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	I dont know any other
2006-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	just open firefox and type "my ip" in the address bar, hit enter
2006-01-28T17:28:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	i am given a different IP everytime I log in
2006-01-28T17:28:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	ok
2006-01-28T17:28:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	myip only took me to some website
2006-01-28T17:29:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah it should but make sure it's my ip with a space
2006-01-28T17:30:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	www.whatismyip.com also works
2006-01-28T17:31:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	I found this:  www.grc.com <-- it checks all ports
2006-01-28T17:31:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	that wokrs too, I just like local tools :)
2006-01-28T17:31:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	its the same as when I type /dns lightbright  :)
2006-01-28T17:32:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	oh, sorry.  My bad :) dint' know that
2006-01-28T17:32:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	it doesnt tell me anything when I scan!  so thats good sign yes? :)
2006-01-28T17:33:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah that's good
2006-01-28T17:33:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	you're got pretty good security going.  the rest is up to your activities on the web :)
2006-01-28T17:34:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	ok :) thanks
2006-01-28T17:34:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	for future refernece, www.grc.com does port scans
2006-01-28T17:34:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	k! XP
2006-01-28T17:35:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	XP?
2006-01-28T17:36:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	like a :), with crossed eyes and sticking out his tongue
2006-01-28T17:37:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	that website said NO ports are seen and my system is in perfect stealth mode :)
2006-01-28T17:38:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	Your system has achieved a perfect "TruStealth" rating
2006-01-28T17:39:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	what does it say about your system?
2006-01-28T17:39:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	I have a couple of ports open
2006-01-28T17:40:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	which ones?
2006-01-28T17:40:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	did you do a ALL PORTS scan?
2006-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	i used my local utility
2006-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	I'm not gonna broadcast my ports to the world :)
2006-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2
2006-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	try that it does a port scan
2006-01-28T17:41:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	and gives a report
2006-01-28T17:42:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	go to http://www.grc.com/default.htm and chose SHIELDS UP!
2006-01-28T17:44:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yeah I'm pretty much closed up
2006-01-28T17:44:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	what ports were open?
2006-01-28T17:45:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	100% of all my ports were closed :)
2006-01-28T17:45:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	but it's open cause i want it to be
2006-01-28T17:45:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	whats 22 used for?
2006-01-28T17:45:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	ah ok
2006-01-28T17:46:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	Brickmaker does have a point though, cause Green is stealth, not closed, and that only scans first 1500
2006-01-28T17:46:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	you do realize there are a bajillion ports
2006-01-28T17:46:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	so what else can I do?
2006-01-28T17:46:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	don't worry about it; you can't ever know for sure and be absolutly sure
2006-01-28T17:46:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	yeah true
2006-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	lemme put it this way.  Odds are, if someone really wanted in, you wouldn't be able to stop them (if they knew what they were doing)
2006-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	the only perfect security is to not connect to the internet
2006-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	yeah true
2006-01-28T17:48:00.000Z	lightbright	ssstormy	but I only seek to make it most secure as human possible for me
2006-01-28T17:48:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	yup and you're pretty much there
2006-01-28T17:51:00.000Z	ssstormy	lightbright	a bunch of security packages
