2009-03-11T20:13:00.000Z	QQQ		when I move whateverApp to my external hd and run: ln -s media/externaldrive/usr/whateverApp /usr/whateverApp how will the updates on whateverApp behave?
2009-03-11T20:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	you shouldn't do that.
2009-03-11T20:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	/usr/ belongs to the package manager. you shouldn't mess with it manually unless you know exactly what you're doing
2009-03-11T20:14:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	I need to free some space somehow...
2009-03-11T20:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	for starters run "apt-cache clean" :)
2009-03-11T20:15:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	and moving/installing apps too my external drivve was a great solution (i thought)
2009-03-11T20:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it's not really so easy.
2009-03-11T20:15:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	did that :) but I have 5gb only on my ssd
2009-03-11T20:15:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	/usr usually doesn't take that much space anyway
2009-03-11T20:16:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	anyway, moving stuff there is possible, but not with simple symlinks.
2009-03-11T20:17:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	the diskspace analyser does show 3,5gb of 6,3GB used. I wonder what the rest is
2009-03-11T20:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	however, if you did that you would be unable to use the system without the external drive.
2009-03-11T20:17:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	that sucked...
2009-03-11T20:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	you might want to look for big files in /home perhaps and move them to the external drive?
2009-03-11T20:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	or remove some packages you don't need :)
2009-03-11T20:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	you still have 2GB of free space, which is plenty.
2009-03-11T20:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	don't worry about it too much :)
2009-03-11T20:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	just store big files on the external drive.
2009-03-11T20:19:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	no i have 150mb left
2009-03-11T20:20:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	try removing some packages?
2009-03-11T20:21:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	which? I need most of my apps (all bigger ones are uninstalled by now)
2009-03-11T20:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	anyway, I strongly recommend against doing anything weird with /usr; just try to find out where the space is going.
2009-03-11T20:22:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	okey. to bad I can't make use of my 40GB external for apps (dont have many (big-)files)
2009-03-11T20:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	if you have most of your bigger apps uninstalled then /usr/ really shouldn't be taking more than 2 GB :/
2009-03-11T20:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	make sure you don't have anything big in /tmp/?
2009-03-11T20:24:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	oh, stupid I'll check that now (but did it some time ago)
2009-03-11T20:24:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	tmp is 2,5 mb
2009-03-11T20:24:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	/usr/ is 2,5 GB
2009-03-11T20:25:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	that sounds okay for /usr
2009-03-11T20:25:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	550 says  the diskspacemanager/explorer
2009-03-11T20:25:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	for home
2009-03-11T20:28:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	if it's showing 3.5, how come you have only 150MB left?
2009-03-11T20:29:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	that doesn't quite make sense :/
2009-03-11T20:29:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	what does df -h tell you?
2009-03-11T20:29:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	yeah...
2009-03-11T20:30:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	/dev/sdb5             6,4G  5,9G  146M  98% /
2009-03-11T20:30:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	and some minor 0% or 1% things
2009-03-11T20:31:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	are there by chance any big files in / for whatever reason? :P
2009-03-11T20:31:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	no, only 2 making 10mb
2009-03-11T20:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	run du -sh /*
2009-03-11T20:32:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	I c :)
2009-03-11T20:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	du just counts diskspace, it's nothing malicious :)
2009-03-11T20:34:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	takes a while..
2009-03-11T20:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	yeah.
2009-03-11T20:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it goes through everything on your disk :P
2009-03-11T20:35:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	2,4G /root; 2,6G /usr
2009-03-11T20:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	/root is huge :|
2009-03-11T20:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	go see what it contains
2009-03-11T20:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it's root's home dir; it should be a few KB at most.
2009-03-11T20:36:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	nautillus shows nothing
2009-03-11T20:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	ls -la /root/
2009-03-11T20:37:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	-rw-------  1 root root  256 2009-01-09 01:17 .pulse-cookie
2009-03-11T20:37:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	is that a huge file?
2009-03-11T20:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	nah
2009-03-11T20:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it's in blocks.
2009-03-11T20:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	use ls -lah to see sizes in KB/MB/GB
2009-03-11T20:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	if there are any subdirectories in /root/, check them too
2009-03-11T20:39:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	http://paste.ubuntu.com/129826/
2009-03-11T20:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	taht doesn't tell much... hm
2009-03-11T20:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	do ls -lahR /root/ next
2009-03-11T20:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	recursive :/
2009-03-11T20:41:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	oh, thats loads of output
2009-03-11T20:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	yeah, it is
2009-03-11T20:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	but pastebin saves :)
2009-03-11T20:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	you can redirect to a file if it's too much
2009-03-11T20:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	do ls -lahR /root/ > output.file
2009-03-11T20:46:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/129829/
2009-03-11T20:47:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	root's trash is full of files!
2009-03-11T20:48:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	how comes?
2009-03-11T20:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	I have no idea
2009-03-11T20:48:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	hmkay, so I will just emtpy the trash as root?
2009-03-11T20:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	try doing "sudo -rm -rf /root/.local/share/Trash/files"
2009-03-11T20:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	will free 800MB :)
2009-03-11T20:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	no,  actually. a lot more :P
2009-03-11T20:49:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	did you log in as root at some point? :/
2009-03-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	oh damn
2009-03-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	I just realised my rm command was wrong :)
2009-03-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it's "sudo rm -rf /root/.local/share/Trash/files"
2009-03-11T20:50:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	a allready wondered and wanted to do it with a sudo nautilus
2009-03-11T20:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	don't use sudo with GUI apps
2009-03-11T20:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it messes up things.
2009-03-11T20:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	use gksudo instead
2009-03-11T20:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	anyway, did you get the files removed? :)
2009-03-11T20:52:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	AY!!! IT WORKED!
2009-03-11T20:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	yeah. so from now on, don't run nautilus with "sudo"; use gksudo instead :)
2009-03-11T20:53:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	2,4GB free space, thx my personal hero for today
2009-03-11T20:53:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	you think that was the problem? (might be)
2009-03-11T20:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	yeah
2009-03-11T20:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	it set your home dir (and trash) to be root's
2009-03-11T20:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	so all the trash was "hidden"
2009-03-11T20:54:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	okey, If there is any photoshop/flash thing I could do for you: ask now :)
2009-03-11T20:55:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	k, so thx (maybe you want to recommend a firewall to me, don't want to check them one by one)
2009-03-11T20:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	QQQ	I don't know much about that, but I hear firestarter is popular :/
2009-03-11T20:56:00.000Z	QQQ	Chousuke	tried that but disliked it, thx anyway and bye
