2008-11-18T19:48:00.000Z	xiroV		Can anyone help me finding a touchpad driver? I
2008-11-18T19:48:00.000Z	xiroV		*I'm new to linux..
2008-11-18T19:48:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	what's the make/model?
2008-11-18T19:49:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	My laptop is a Acer Aspire 5520
2008-11-18T19:49:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	being new is not a long term affliction, we were all new once
2008-11-18T19:50:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	I know :) But it's good to make people aware, that i'm new, so they can explain to me how it works, in a language i understand..
2008-11-18T19:51:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	::nods:: is nice to know
2008-11-18T19:52:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	can lspci see it?
2008-11-18T19:52:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	And i truely hope, that i'll get more knowledge, so maybe I can help newbies, some day :)
2008-11-18T19:53:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	uhm.. nope.. i don't see it
2008-11-18T19:56:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	know if the touchpad is something other then your standard wacom?
2008-11-18T19:56:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	they usually just work... did the touchpad work in windows?
2008-11-18T19:57:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	What do you mean about "wacom"?
2008-11-18T19:58:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	wait.... meant synaptics.... was my understanding touchpads are usually compatible with each other
2008-11-18T19:58:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	Well.. The touchpad is working.. but i miss a driver for it... I had to install a driver in windows too, but i could use the touchpad without.. it just makes the movement more smooth.
2008-11-18T19:59:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	hmm
2008-11-18T19:59:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	couldn't tell you
2008-11-18T19:59:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	most of the posts I see on the ubuntu forums don't seem to have a problem w/ the touchpad out of the box
2008-11-18T19:59:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	thus my puzzlement
2008-11-18T20:00:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	using a touchpad without a driver, is like using one of the old mouses with a ball inside, with the cencors really dirty.. if you know what i mean..
2008-11-18T20:01:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	OHHH YEAH I gotcha... just never really was a big touchpad guy... tend to prefer the nipple mouse in the middle of my keyboard
2008-11-18T20:02:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	well.. i have read some articles about touchpad driver in linux, but i couldnt find any exact explanation on how to install it.
2008-11-18T20:03:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	yeah, couldn't tell you... sorry I couldn't be of more help... thought your touchpad wasn't working @ all
2008-11-18T20:03:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	well.. im just trying to get used to touchpad.. but its so stupid when the movements is so rough, you kno..
2008-11-18T20:04:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	No problem dude :) thanks for taking your time, anyways :)
2008-11-18T20:04:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	wouldn't know... when I use the one on my T41, seems about as smooth as I'd expect (which is to say.... bad... since its a touchpad ;) )
2008-11-18T20:04:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	one of the reasons I shut it off
2008-11-18T20:05:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	any other problems?
2008-11-18T20:05:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	well.. i don't think touchpads are bad.. the can get really easy to use, and smooth, if you just got a driver for it.
2008-11-18T20:05:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	or questions?
2008-11-18T20:05:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	but they sure is a pain in the @ss to use without, thou
2008-11-18T20:06:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	heh
2008-11-18T20:06:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	and yea.. i actually got a problem
2008-11-18T20:07:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	you know on laptops.. there usually is a way to turn volume up or down... on my laptop it worked fine, untill some weeks ago.. now i can only turn the sound up and down, using the mouse, manually.. if you know what it mean..
2008-11-18T20:08:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	ok..... (did just find something for you btw...) in a terminal type "dmesg | grep 'ImPS/2' " sans double quots
2008-11-18T20:08:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	yep... have the same problem on xubuntu... they seem to have disabled the volume control keys having an effect on the volume control panel applet
2008-11-18T20:09:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	the volume box appears when i turn volume up and down, but apparently it doesn't work..
2008-11-18T20:09:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	still getting to the bottom of that over here ;)
2008-11-18T20:09:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	'doesn't work?'
2008-11-18T20:09:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	as in... doesn't actually change the volume in the hardware?
2008-11-18T20:11:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	Exactly.. it doesn't turn the volume up or down, even thou it appears to, on the screen
2008-11-18T20:11:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	greaaat
2008-11-18T20:11:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	What was does commands? O.o
2008-11-18T20:11:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	did you try running that dmesg command I sent you?
2008-11-18T20:11:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	dmesg pokes the kernel and sees what's been happening since startup
2008-11-18T20:11:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	was it 1 command, or 2?
2008-11-18T20:12:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	grep searches through standard input (or a file) and displays lines containing a specified regular expression
2008-11-18T20:12:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	was two... one piped into the other
2008-11-18T20:12:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	will resend wait 1
2008-11-18T20:13:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	ok..... (did just find something for you btw...) in a terminal type "dmesg | grep 'ImPS/2' " sans double quotes
2008-11-18T20:14:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	so i should just copy/paste "dmesg | grep 'ImPS/2'" into terminal?
2008-11-18T20:14:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	with no double quotes
2008-11-18T20:14:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	kk
2008-11-18T20:15:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	may see a line looks like this: 'input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse'
2008-11-18T20:15:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	so.. what now?
2008-11-18T20:15:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	do you see the line?
2008-11-18T20:15:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	So i have to paste it as 2 seperate commands?
2008-11-18T20:16:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	if i just paste it in the same line, nothing appears
2008-11-18T20:16:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	might've built the regex wrong following line will be command just paste straight in:
2008-11-18T20:17:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	dmesg | grep "Generic Wheel Mouse"
2008-11-18T20:17:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	leave those double quotes in
2008-11-18T20:17:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	still nothing appears
2008-11-18T20:18:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	hmmm.... one more
2008-11-18T20:18:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	dmesg | grep "ALPS GlidePoint"
2008-11-18T20:19:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	following line appeared: [   46.207429] input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint as /devices/platform/i8042/serio1/input/input8
2008-11-18T20:19:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	ok.... so the kernel knows its an ALPS and not a generic mouse....
2008-11-18T20:20:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	apparently at one point, that's the driver the mouse module loaded for your touchpad.... yours seems to have the proper behavior though
2008-11-18T20:21:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	uhm?
2008-11-18T20:21:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	ahhh.... got something more for you
2008-11-18T20:23:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	perhaps this will be of help: http://www.felipe-alfaro.org/blog/2005/08/19/alps-glidepoint-under-linux-with-xorg/
2008-11-18T20:23:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	once you have the actual make / model of specific hardware, its ALOT easier to locate information
2008-11-18T20:24:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	directions are for redhat, but the xorg.conf pieces should be similar
2008-11-18T20:24:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	okay.. well.. can you give me a fast explanation on what "x.org" is? i see that everywhere
2008-11-18T20:25:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	sure.... very fast (am @ work heh)
2008-11-18T20:25:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	xorg is the graphical system most unixes use
2008-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	on top of that you have your desktop environment (such as KDE, GNOME, XFCE, fluxbox) and various gui programs which run within it
2008-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	Ahh.. okay.. so x.org is simply a GUI ?
2008-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	......X.org is more a graphical backend
2008-11-18T20:27:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	Ah.. so x.org is a place where the gui works on? or something like that?
2008-11-18T20:27:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	a workhorse which graphical toolkits use to actually color the pixels on-screen and get input from the mouse/keyboard etc when in GUI mode
2008-11-18T20:28:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	a VERY rough (and probably grossly inaccurate comparison would be directX)
2008-11-18T20:28:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	Ah... okay :) well.. thanks.. won't bother you anymore ^^ i'll see if i can make it work
2008-11-18T20:29:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	think your getting it
2008-11-18T20:29:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	more information: www.x.org
2008-11-18T20:32:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	:)
2008-11-18T20:35:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	see.... still learning myself ;)
2008-11-18T20:37:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	Sure ^^ I think it would be kinda boring if everyone knew everything ;)
2008-11-18T20:38:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	but i really don't understand the link you send me..
2008-11-18T20:38:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	or it would mean everything would be due for SERIOUS change b/c it would mean there was no more innovation
2008-11-18T20:39:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	should i just do what it tells me, and it should work?
2008-11-18T20:41:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	?
2008-11-18T20:42:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	other option is take a look @ the ubuntuforums searching for glidepoint
2008-11-18T20:45:00.000Z	xiroV	neozen	okay.. thanks
2008-11-18T20:45:00.000Z	neozen	xiroV	you are most welcome, sorry I couldn't be of more help
