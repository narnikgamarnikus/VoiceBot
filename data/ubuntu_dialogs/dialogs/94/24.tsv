2010-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	Wilabob		OK, I really need help.... I followed this guide to make a backup of my system http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35087 Then I reinstalled in order to get rid of my windows partition. I am now trying to restore and I run the command tar xvpfz backup.tgz -C / and it goes for awhile and says tar: Skipping to next header then tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
2010-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	are you restoring your backup from a live environment?
2010-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Yes
2010-03-31T07:18:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	instead of "-C /" you probably want the mounted root of your hdd, something like "-C /media/Ubuntudisk/"
2010-03-31T07:19:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Sorry... I'm not running off the cd I installed a new ubuntu and I'm running off the harddrive
2010-03-31T07:20:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	you need to do the restore from a liveCD. and is the version of ubuntu you backed up the same as the one you installed?
2010-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Yes
2010-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	good. in the future, just so you know, you can remove windows without reinstalling. you can just use Partition Editor to delete the windows partition and get grub to update its list
2010-03-31T07:22:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	So I should boot the live cd?
2010-03-31T07:23:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	By the way, I knew that but I wanted to expand my ubuntu partition as well so I had more space
2010-03-31T07:24:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	yes. then do the restore with the -C pointing at a *mounted* copy of your hdd
2010-03-31T07:25:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	OK, Thanks
2010-03-31T07:29:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	How do I find the location of my Hard Drive when on the live cd
2010-03-31T07:30:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	you click on Places at the top and click on on the name of your drive. then in a terminal you list /media with "ls /media" and the name of your disk should be in there
2010-03-31T07:30:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	then you use "-C /media/ubuntudiskname"
2010-03-31T07:32:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Dammit, same error
2010-03-31T07:32:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	are you using "sudo tar" ?
2010-03-31T07:33:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Yes I'm root
2010-03-31T07:34:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Tried again... Sam thing.
2010-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	please copy and paste into a pastebin what you have in your terminal with the tar commands and the output
2010-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Can't I have no internet. I had to use the windows drivers to get the wireless card working. That's why I need to restore
2010-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	no ethernet?
2010-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Not where the computer is
2010-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	do you get any message saying something like "this doesn't look like a tar archive"?
2010-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	No
2010-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	The error is tar: Skipping to next header then tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
2010-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	eh well in that guide you're following it mentions that "exit delayed from previous errors" issue and says to ignore it
2010-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	you could add the -v flag to tar and pipe it to a file for examination
2010-03-31T07:42:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	otherwise if you don't notice any files you wanted are gone, then it might be okay to just figure the backup restore worked
2010-03-31T07:42:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Well it quits way too early.
2010-03-31T07:43:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	So the command is sudo tar -v xvpfz Backup.tgz -C /media/.......
2010-03-31T07:44:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	are there some files you need more than others? say the stuff in /home?
2010-03-31T07:45:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	I backed up all of the root
2010-03-31T07:45:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	(/)
2010-03-31T07:45:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	i'm thinking of extracting it in parts though
2010-03-31T07:45:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Ok
2010-03-31T07:46:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	I don't know if I need much/any of the stuff from /home
2010-03-31T07:47:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	if you do "tar tf Backup.tgz | head", do the lines start with / ?
2010-03-31T07:48:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	just running that command I get No file or directory
2010-03-31T07:49:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	should run that in the directory you have the Backup.tgz
2010-03-31T07:50:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	I did cd /media/... and I still get the error
2010-03-31T07:51:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	where is your Backup.tgz?
2010-03-31T07:51:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	On my hard drive in the root directory
2010-03-31T07:53:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	(all without quotes) cd there, type "tar tf Backu" then hit tab
2010-03-31T07:53:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	btw | is pipe, above the \ on US keyboard layouts.
2010-03-31T07:53:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	after tab type "| head"
2010-03-31T07:56:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	ah yeah that's good to know.
2010-03-31T07:59:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Any ideas?
2010-03-31T07:59:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	tar xvpfz Backup.tgz --exclude=/media -C /media/ubuntudisk
2010-03-31T08:00:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	xvpzf rather
2010-03-31T08:03:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	didn't work :'(
2010-03-31T08:03:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	what was the output?
2010-03-31T08:05:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	tar: Skipping to next header and tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
2010-03-31T08:06:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	alright try this:  tar xvpzf Backup.tgz -C /media/ubuntudisk /home
2010-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	same thing
2010-03-31T08:09:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	is it a problem with the backup?
2010-03-31T08:09:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	alright try this: sudo tar xpzf Backup.tgz -C /media/ubuntudisk /etc
2010-03-31T08:09:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	we'll find out
2010-03-31T08:11:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	with a space between /media/ubuntudick and /ect it said tar: skipping to next header and tar: /ect: Not found in archive and tar: exiting with failure status due to previous error
2010-03-31T08:13:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	/etc not /ect
2010-03-31T08:13:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	same thing
2010-03-31T08:16:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	what is the output of "tar tvfz Backup.tgz" ?
2010-03-31T08:20:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	tar: Skipping to next header tar: exiting with failure status due to previous errors
2010-03-31T08:24:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	alright i'm putting together a command
2010-03-31T08:24:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	make sure you're in the mounted root of your drive, the *same* dir as Backup.tgz
2010-03-31T08:27:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	gunzip -c Backup.tgz | cpio -ivduH tar
2010-03-31T08:27:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	type that exactly
2010-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Its going really fast and saying a lot of permission denied and malformed number
2010-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	are you using sudo or a bash as root?
2010-03-31T08:30:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	ctrl+c it and do "sudo su"
2010-03-31T08:32:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	Thats better
2010-03-31T08:32:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	sudo -i would also work
2010-03-31T08:32:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	seem like it's working?
2010-03-31T08:33:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	it got to it's usual spot then started spitting out malformed number
2010-03-31T08:33:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	what's the usual spot?
2010-03-31T08:33:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	like usr/share/ then something else
2010-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	it's back to regular things now
2010-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	I think it might be working !
2010-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	wait for it to finish, then try booting into it and checking if what you wanted restored gets restored
2010-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	btw in the future, it's better to use integrated backup tools rather than commands from a forum if one isn't experienced in the interworkings of tools like tar.
2010-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	this is a better way to backup: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem
2010-03-31T08:34:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	I tried that and it didn't seem to work for me
2010-03-31T08:35:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem/SimpleBackupSuite
2010-03-31T08:35:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	that's the program I used first and it didn't seem to even start backing up
2010-03-31T08:36:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	but it's going alot further...
2010-03-31T08:36:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	WTF? chinese characters?
2010-03-31T08:36:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	heh no idea. it's your system :P
2010-03-31T08:37:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	here's something you might want to use in the future: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/back-in-time-a-simple-backup-tool-for-ubuntu.html
2010-03-31T08:52:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	welcome back
2010-03-31T08:53:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	do you remember what the command was that you gave me? The comp just went to sleep and won't come back on. I'll write it down now...
2010-03-31T08:53:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	here's something you might want to use in the future: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/back-in-time-a-simple-backup-tool-for-ubuntu.html
2010-03-31T08:53:00.000Z	chelz	Wilabob	sudo -i        then   gunzip -c Backup.tgz | cpio -ivduH tar
2010-03-31T08:54:00.000Z	Wilabob	chelz	thanks a bunch
