2007-04-24T10:51:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 ok
2007-04-24T10:52:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 then I dont get it I am sharing two usb hd to the other computer. One is shared without problem the other isnt. The only diference is that one is called "disk" and the other is called "MAXTOR"
2007-04-24T10:54:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	what is the file system of two usb hd?
2007-04-24T10:55:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	what u mean called here??? is disk label or the /address/path?
2007-04-24T10:55:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 disk (the one working) is ext3 and MAXTOR (not working) is ntfs, but I have installed the ntfs read/write packages and they are working
2007-04-24T10:56:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 path and name
2007-04-24T10:57:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	i not sure about ntfs....to share over nfs....i need to check 1st
2007-04-24T10:57:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 is it posible that only one mount is allowed? because now that I have "disk" mounted I am trying to mount a random folder that before was working and sais that server refuses
2007-04-24T10:57:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 sais server:permision denied
2007-04-24T10:58:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	u can mount as many as u want...is the permission u need to set it correctly
2007-04-24T11:00:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	I mount one thing, then unmount it, then I mount another thing, then I try to mount the first one and it doesnt work
2007-04-24T11:01:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	what is the error msg when u mount back the '1st thing'
2007-04-24T11:02:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 failed, reason given by server:Permision denied
2007-04-24T11:02:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	did u put sudo in front the mount?
2007-04-24T11:03:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 yes
2007-04-24T11:04:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	back to the NTFS with nfs.....if i not wrong there is another type read/write option for ntfs driver u need to find it out....
2007-04-24T11:05:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 ok, but first of all I need to solve the mounting more than one thing
2007-04-24T11:05:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 thanks for the help
2007-04-24T11:05:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/baslinux/2004-November/005616.html check this out
2007-04-24T11:08:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	u try to restart the nfs-kernel-server $ sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
2007-04-24T11:09:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	then mount again
2007-04-24T11:09:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 I see, so there is no way I am going to be able to share a ntfs hd through nfs
2007-04-24T11:11:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	u can check the smbclient that mention on that site
2007-04-24T11:12:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 I am guessing smbclient is samba client, so samba sharing
2007-04-24T11:14:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	ya....have a try on samba
2007-04-24T11:15:00.000Z	Hugo	teckfatt	 is very weird I have restarted the computer, and only mounting one nfs device from boot (and mounts ok) and when I try to mount another random folder
2007-04-24T11:17:00.000Z	teckfatt	Hugo	u need to put the /address/to/share/folder in the /etc/exports , then u can mount it with nfs
