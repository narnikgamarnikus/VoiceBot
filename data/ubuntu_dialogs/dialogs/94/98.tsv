2006-08-05T06:30:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	i think mozilla-browser has composer with it
2006-08-05T06:30:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	on the WYSIWYG, NVU

2006-08-05T06:31:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	how can I install the mozilla composer?
2006-08-05T06:32:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	I am telling you if you do 'sudo aptitude install mozilla-browser' it will install composer
2006-08-05T06:33:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	ok!  any other smaller application that does the same?

2007-03-22T16:58:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	what you mean?
2007-03-24T06:55:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	does /media/sda3 and /media/sda4 have the partitions mounted in them
2007-03-24T06:51:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	any ideas pls?
2007-03-24T06:51:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	pastebin /etc/fstab
2007-03-24T06:52:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	ok
2007-03-24T06:53:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11790/
2007-03-24T06:53:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	I havent chantged fstab. and it was showing my 2 partitions before today.  the only thing I did today was an upgdate and upgrade
2007-03-24T06:53:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	and there is nothing in /media/hda4
2007-03-24T06:53:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	and there is nothing in /media/sda4
2007-03-24T06:54:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	or sda3
2007-03-24T06:54:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	it used to show sda3
2007-03-24T06:54:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	whats changed my fstab?
2007-03-24T06:54:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	does /media/sda3 and /media/sda4 have the partitions mounted in them
2007-03-24T06:54:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	they always loaded before today
2007-03-24T06:55:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	I am trying to figure out if maybe for some reason the gui stopped putting the icons on the desktop or if your drives aren't mounting, so look in /media/sda3 and /media/sda4 and see if they are there
2007-03-24T06:55:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	according to the date stamp!  fstab hasnt been alteered since March 17.  And it was showing my 2 NTFS partitions until today
2007-03-24T06:56:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	the fstab is the same as before when it was working
2007-03-24T06:56:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	I am trying to figure out if maybe for some reason the gui stopped putting the icons on the desktop or if your drives aren't mounting, so look in /media/sda3 and /media/sda4 and see if they are there
2007-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	they are in media folder, but when I click on them, no files are showing/
2007-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	ok
2007-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	this is very weird as it wwas working fine until today
2007-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	any solutions you know about?
2007-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	well I have never dealt with ntfs-3g however it looks fine other than that, do "sudo mount /dev/sda3" and see if it shows up in /media/sda3 like it should
2007-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	MS vista didnt shut down properly last time, thats it!  im going to boot it again and shut it down
2007-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	then ubuntu should load them
2007-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	never dealt with that error before. Looks like that is your problem though. I heard ntfs-3g was experimental and shouldn't be used to write to ntfs unless absolutely needed maybe it hosed your drive
2007-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	that command gave me the reason, thanks :)
2007-03-24T07:00:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	ok that would make sense
2007-03-24T07:00:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	nothing hosed anything!  last time I loaded MS windows, it froze and didnt shut down properly
2007-03-24T07:00:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	and therefore the logfile is corrupted got you
2007-04-07T09:01:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	you would know :)
2007-04-10T06:38:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	are you talking about SGD
2007-04-10T06:39:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	super grub disk
2007-04-10T06:39:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	just google super grub disk
2007-04-10T06:39:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	dont think thats it
2007-04-10T06:40:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	im about to destroy perhaps my MBR and Grub!  In case I do, I need a bootable DVD that will still load Ubuntu and my Windows.  Any ideas?
2007-04-10T06:40:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	well SGD is the only thing that I have heard of that comes close to what you are talking about
2007-04-10T06:44:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	where can I get latest super grub?
2007-04-10T06:44:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/ ?
2007-04-10T06:44:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	google I guess. I used it once and it failed me so I didn't really pay much attention
2007-04-10T06:45:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	i found an ISo that contains gparted, sysresc and SGD
2007-04-10T06:45:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	goodie
2007-04-10T06:46:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	thats great then for if MBR and bootsectors, Grub etc gets corrupted, I can still load Ubuntu or MS Windows!
2007-04-10T06:46:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	until I can find a perm solution.
2007-04-10T06:47:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	but would that also see my Windows partition and include that in the restore of grub?
2007-04-10T06:47:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	you could probably, you may have to manually edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-04-10T06:47:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	I have a bootable ubuntu USB Stick version.  When I load that, how would I restore grub to my HDD from that?
2007-04-10T06:48:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	but doesnt it look for my existing menu.lust and use that?
2007-04-10T06:48:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	don't think so, either way you can edit your existing menu.lst from live cd
2007-04-10T06:49:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	what? which one?
2007-04-10T06:49:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	it doesnt need editing
2007-04-10T06:49:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	my current menu.list is pefect! why edit it?
2007-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	I was saying that if you wanted to, you could from live cd therefore making live cd restore of grub possible and good
2007-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	if I resintall Grub from a liveCD, what menu.list will the new Grub look for?
2007-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	it won't
2007-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	so Grub wont load anyhing?
2007-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	grub writes its own menu.lst when you do sudo update-grub
2007-04-10T06:50:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	if the new grub wont load any menu.list, what good is it?
2007-04-10T06:51:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	where wll it write it to?
2007-04-10T06:51:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	you say if I type:  sudo update-grub, it creates a new menu.list!  But wheere does it save it?  it cant save it to the LIVECD
2007-04-10T06:52:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	where exacrtly is the new menu.list saved?  so then I can go there and reaplce it with my orginal menu.list
2007-04-10T06:56:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	why d you always accuse people of bneing a troll when they have struggles to understand?
2007-04-10T06:56:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	im very dissappointed you accuse me of trolling just cause I was struggling to understand :(
2007-04-10T06:57:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	it looked like you were trolling because you asked the same question after I answered it, and then I answered it again in a different way, and then you asked again and I thought you were just winding me up
2007-04-10T06:57:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	i dont troll here ever!  I respect everyone times too much!  but pls empahise, some ppl struggle to understand more than others.  pls dont accuse ppl faselely. ty
2007-04-10T06:58:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	all I wanted to understand was how can I restore Grub and have it use my old menu.list which has an enrrty to load my MS windows too.
2007-04-10T06:58:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	and I still dont know how
2007-04-10T06:59:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	ok ty.
2007-04-10T07:00:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	that link is inteesting!  so my question is.  Can I copy menu.list to my Windows partition and tell Grub to load it from there!  this way I can totally remove Ubuntu partition.    I dont need it because I now run Ubuntu from USB stick
2007-04-10T07:01:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	would that work?  or does menu.list have to be on ext3 ubuntu partition?
2007-04-10T07:01:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	no you can't
2007-04-10T07:01:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	why not?
2007-04-10T07:01:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	is there a way of getting Grub to load my MS woindows if there are not ext3 ubuntu partitions on my HDD?
2007-04-10T07:01:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	no, it won't know where to find it
2007-04-10T07:02:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	why cant I point it to it using those command on that webpage you gave me?
2007-04-10T07:03:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	if I type find /boot/grub/stage1, wont it find it if I copy that whole folder over to my MS windows partition?
2007-04-10T07:03:00.000Z	bruenig	eternaljoy	it won't work, you can try if you want. I have tired, a little worn down, sorry. I am trying to learn some more sed now, I just kind of keep this open to check in occasionally
2007-04-10T07:03:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	ok ty for your time.
2007-04-26T16:54:00.000Z	eternaljoy	bruenig	hello :)  u must be here 60+hours every week. You sure have lots of free time
