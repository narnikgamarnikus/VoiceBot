2005-05-06T10:30:00.000Z	holycow		gimp is a completely underrated application, i really wish people would give it a serious try ... it's just hard to 'unlearn'
2005-05-06T10:32:00.000Z	holycow		dataw0lf, i'm sorry to get personal btw ...
2005-05-06T10:32:00.000Z	holycow		dataw0lf, your rather... negative response seemed unfounded and personal
2005-05-06T10:33:00.000Z	holycow		dataw0lf, *nod* your usecase doesn't sound like a printe/other graphic design use case tho ... maybe there are tools its missing for you?
2005-05-06T10:34:00.000Z	holycow		dataw0lf, if i had the time i would personally offer tutorials to any graphic designer taht wanted to try gimp tho

2005-05-11T13:48:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	holycow i developted 60node cluster and complex firewall <-- okay now you got my attention
2005-05-11T13:48:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	? :))
2005-05-11T13:49:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	debian
2005-05-11T13:49:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	but i'm planing to swith on ubuntu
2005-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	at least on clients... server will stay on debian
2005-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	right on
2005-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	but i'll see...
2005-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	bigest problem is that this 60 computers are diskless
2005-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	and when i update/upgrade one, rest are too
2005-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	yeah lots of variables depending on the job it needs to do
2005-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	you mount from a central disk array right?
2005-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	but that is slow...
2005-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	yeah... imagine one server with 60 nodes, catching mount from it
2005-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	that server lives on the edge :)
2005-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	so, i'm planing to put disks in all clients
2005-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	and have 60 separate ubuntu instalations
2005-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	with ubuntu that's easy, there aren't so much updates as in sarge
2005-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	and i can have stable distro for 18 months
2005-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	how are you getting to install so many linux clients then?
2005-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	heh... i'll pay 2 guys to work that for me :)
2005-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	i'll develop kickstart file and build my own installation
2005-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	it will be "put CD in and go to other comp"
2005-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	instalaion will do all things by it self
2005-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	i plan on the same thing for all of our offices
2005-05-11T13:56:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	all clients will have hd's but all home dirs backed up live with rsync or some such.   the kickstarted reimage will restore latest backup files and theyre off and running
2005-05-11T13:56:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	cool to see that happening accross the pond :)
2005-05-11T13:56:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	http://cluster.grad.hr/index.php?page=monitor
2005-05-11T13:56:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	use NFS, not rsync
2005-05-11T13:56:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	not over the internet :)
2005-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	ah... over the net..
2005-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	check out NFSv4
2005-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	i think they fixed some security issues, but i'm not sure...
2005-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	my cluster is still on 2.4 :)
2005-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	cool
2005-05-14T11:06:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	apt-get install runit
2005-05-14T11:06:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	somehow i don't feel like it :)
2005-05-14T11:07:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	i could try, maybe...
2005-05-14T11:08:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	xmms2
2005-05-14T11:08:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	but that's something totally different
2005-05-14T11:09:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	xmms2.xmms.org
2005-05-14T11:10:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	*nod*
2005-05-14T11:54:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	the runit scripts seem incredibly simple ... neat --> http://smarden.org/runit/runscripts.html#privoxy
2005-05-14T11:54:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	but the system doesn't boot :)
2005-05-14T11:54:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	thats because you need runit scripts :)
2005-05-14T12:58:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	hey, it almost seems like ... i donno ... you have used debian once before eh?
2005-05-14T12:59:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	i don't see ubuntu being any different than debian :)
2005-05-18T16:11:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	accidentally tho, they didn't mean to commoditize it and loose control over it
2005-05-26T12:09:00.000Z	ivoks	holycow	to much to read :)
2005-05-26T12:16:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	but well worth it
2005-06-22T12:08:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	rofl
2005-06-22T12:08:00.000Z	holycow	ivoks	every windows user i run into that wants to try linux, i tell them to forget everything they learned on windows
