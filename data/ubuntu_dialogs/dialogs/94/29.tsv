2009-09-06T21:52:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	well your grub menu entry needs to be fixed.....
2009-09-06T21:52:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	I'm trying to fix it, but I don't know what to put there
2009-09-06T21:53:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	ok, you need to basically cut and paste line 154 to line 164 needs to pasted to the bottom
2009-09-06T21:54:00.000Z	trineox		how do i use the pastebin and ill paste mine
2009-09-06T21:56:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	After doing that, I get "Error 11: Unrecognized device string"
2009-09-06T21:57:00.000Z	trineox		!pastebinit
2009-09-06T21:58:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ		Does anyone know what a "Error 11: Unrecognized device string" means? I upgraded ubuntu 32 bit to 64 bit, and now I can't mount my windows drive
2009-09-06T22:01:00.000Z	trineox		!paste | trineox
2009-09-06T22:02:00.000Z	trineox		i have no luck with using pastebin...im still a linux newbie
2009-09-06T22:05:00.000Z	trineox		ok thanks ActionParsnip
2009-09-06T22:08:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	check your pastebin i replied to it...that was simple
2009-09-06T22:08:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	look at my menu.lst....all the way at the bottom
2009-09-06T22:11:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	Where are your replies? I cant see them at http://paste.ubuntu.com/266201/
2009-09-06T22:12:00.000Z	trineox		here http://paste.ubuntu.com/266214/
2009-09-06T22:13:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	thanks, i'm trying it now
2009-09-06T22:13:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	no problem now are you having problems accessing your windows drive from linux too or just booting windows?
2009-09-06T22:15:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	now I'm getting error 13, not 11
2009-09-06T22:15:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	Could it be the vista bootloader? Could the ubuntu installer have ruined that?
2009-09-06T22:16:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	it shouldnt have but if you think it might have you can run your vista disk and choose repair
2009-09-06T22:17:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	if you choose vista then it fails it could be the vista bootloader
2009-09-06T22:17:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	ive had a problem before and the repair option repaired it
2009-09-06T22:18:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	just make sure that your grub is correct, because your windows entry isnt in the correct place it should be at the bottom that i do know
2009-09-06T22:19:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	I overwrote my grub with yours.
2009-09-06T22:19:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	just the error message changed from 11 to 13.
2009-09-06T22:19:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	Any ideas on how to fix the vista boot files?
2009-09-06T22:19:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	vista your best option is run your vista disk choose repair it will fix the boot loader
2009-09-06T22:20:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	ill look up your error see if i can help you better
2009-09-06T22:22:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	your grub messed something up. Now I can't even boot into ubuntu any more
2009-09-06T22:23:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	well your ubuntu cd has a repair option for that
2009-09-06T22:23:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	u needed to only correct your grub entry by putting the windows entry to the bottom
2009-09-06T22:24:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	mine obviously wasnt the same i was only showing that my vista entry is at the bottom
2009-09-06T22:24:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	yours was above the ubuntu entries
2009-09-06T22:25:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	oooh, my bad. How can I revert that?
2009-09-06T22:25:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	well best bet would be to run the repair option on your ubuntu cd first
2009-09-06T22:26:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	it will fix the menu
2009-09-06T22:26:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	so, repair ubuntu, then repair windows?
2009-09-06T22:26:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	yes
2009-09-06T22:27:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	where's the repair option?
2009-09-06T22:27:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	well i feel the entry was wrong soo the repair of ubuntu will fix it and you should be able to boot either windows or ubuntu
2009-09-06T22:28:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	once you boot ubuntu cd choose restore
2009-09-06T22:28:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	I booted into the CD, and i don't see a repair option
2009-09-06T22:28:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	restore?
2009-09-06T22:28:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ		Try ubuntu without any change to your computer, Install Ubuntu, Check cd for defects, test memory, boot from first hard disk
2009-09-06T22:29:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	boot without installing
2009-09-06T22:29:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	we can just repaste your old menu
2009-09-06T22:30:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	OK, I chose "Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer"
2009-09-06T22:30:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	good , remember how u edited your menu?
2009-09-06T22:31:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	edit it again but paste your old one from your link which i have
2009-09-06T22:31:00.000Z	TheVenerableZ	trineox	So just paste from my link, but move windows to the bottom?
2009-09-06T22:31:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	yes
2009-09-06T22:32:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	starting with line 154 to 164 that section needs to be pasted to the bottom
2009-09-06T22:32:00.000Z	trineox	TheVenerableZ	your link was http://paste.ubuntu.com/266201/
