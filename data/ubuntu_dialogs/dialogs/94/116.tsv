2005-11-24T10:11:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	remove one or the other and see what happens, they might have "collided"
2005-11-24T10:12:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	I've seen that happen before
2005-11-24T10:12:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	sudo apt-get remove mplayer*
2005-11-24T10:12:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	then try totem, see what it does, then if it's cool, ok, if not then add mplayer back
2005-11-24T10:13:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	OK I'll pull it *all* out again.
2005-11-24T10:13:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	pay attention, just do mplayer, then test totem
2005-11-24T10:13:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	then if it's good ok, if not then pull totem and put in mplayer and test, etc...
2005-11-24T10:14:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	I've had that issue with 3 different distros
2005-11-24T10:14:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok, I missed that line.
2005-11-24T10:14:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Weird thing is... I had all of the imstalled earlier today, and I could at least play non-encrypted DVDs
2005-11-24T10:15:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	test each, totem and mplayer, separately, you'll get a trend, then I can help.
2005-11-24T10:15:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	No prob, just informing you. Thanks... one sec
2005-11-24T10:20:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	(totem:26625): GStreamer-CRITICAL **: how to remove plugins?
2005-11-24T10:21:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	what did you type to get that error?
2005-11-24T10:22:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	That's the fisr "error". I typed: totem /dev/dvd
2005-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	type this first, let's get rid of mplayer, I want to see if you have something mixed up... "sudo apt-get remove mplayer*"
2005-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	and make sure you see that * at the end of that line
2005-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	ALready removed that
2005-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	using the code I just gave you? try it again
2005-11-24T10:23:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Let's me use apt-get this time though.
2005-11-24T10:24:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok: E: Couldn't find package mplayer*
2005-11-24T10:25:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok, then just type "totem" in a terminal and see what output it gives you.
2005-11-24T10:25:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Want me to paste the whole output fo pastebin
2005-11-24T10:26:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	no, just tell me did you get totem or not?
2005-11-24T10:26:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	"sudo apt-get install totem-xine"
2005-11-24T10:28:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok, it opens with only a gtk error, which I've learned to ignore. Happened before.
2005-11-24T10:28:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok so you now have totem but with an error?
2005-11-24T10:29:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	And.. it's playing a non-encrypted DVD, but no sound.
2005-11-24T10:29:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	check "alsamixer" first, make sure everything is pumped up, you know this right?
2005-11-24T10:29:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	just checking, don't know what you know and don't know...
2005-11-24T10:31:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	NP. Yes it's up, almost all the way, and Gaim just bonged as a buddly logged on, about scared me off the couch
2005-11-24T10:31:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok so sound works, now, let's add mplayer back to the mix "sudo apt-get install mplayer*"
2005-11-24T10:32:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	and make sure that * is at the end of that line
2005-11-24T10:32:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	And... I ahve a new laptop. 1.7 Ghz, 1 GB Ram, 100 GB HD, All Intel hardware. It's really choppy video, and bogs down the processor.
2005-11-24T10:32:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	I'll do that.
2005-11-24T10:33:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	it will get there, it's sometimes a matter of "order".
2005-11-24T10:34:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Hmm, that caused a massive dep issue. apt-get crashed
2005-11-24T10:34:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	"sudo apt-get -f install
2005-11-24T10:35:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	No, mplayer-i386 conflicts with mplayer-k6, and with mplayer-586, etc, etc
2005-11-24T10:36:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok then take the * off the end of that line and try it
2005-11-24T10:37:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	That's a virtual package. I should install mplayer-586 though.
2005-11-24T10:37:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	apt-get install mplayer-586   worked
2005-11-24T10:39:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok, Mplayer plays with sound, but not totem
2005-11-24T10:40:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok so this is how much better than before, have we improved? I need to know that.
2005-11-24T10:40:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	I think so, let me compare to an encrypted DVD I had in earlier. I don't expect it to play, but I want to compare behavior.
2005-11-24T10:41:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Weird... I can't get this DVD to eject
2005-11-24T10:42:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	I right click, eject. Error.. but icon is gone, nothing shows on mount. but cd tray is locked
2005-11-24T10:42:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	use a paperclip in the little hole, I've had to do that too when trying to fix this stuff.
2005-11-24T10:43:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Heh, yeah... never had that with this lappy on Ubuntu. :)
2005-11-24T10:43:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	prolly a one time thing
2005-11-24T10:43:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	and you might restart X after this, not reboot, just X
2005-11-24T10:47:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok, yes. it's better than it was when you first started helping. I'm only missing sound on Totem, and css... first things first.
2005-11-24T10:47:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	But, I can't eject anyting manually... "Error: invalid argument". I'll live with that for now until I restart X.
2005-11-24T10:47:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok, then let me think about that. glad it's better.
2005-11-24T10:48:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	reboot, hate to say that but you prolly should
2005-11-24T10:48:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Yes! Thank you so far!!
2005-11-24T10:48:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	lol Hey, this is Linux, no reboots. :)
2005-11-24T10:48:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	I know, they "say" that...but trust me.
2005-11-24T10:49:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok, you're not gonna run and hid are you? ;)
2005-11-24T10:49:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	BRB
2005-11-24T10:49:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	no
2005-11-24T10:52:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Ok, reboot fixed eject issue
2005-11-24T10:52:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	thought so
2005-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Oooh, weird.
2005-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	quit scaring me, I'm going to have my cigar, I thought we had 75% of this kicked.
2005-11-24T10:54:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	haha, sorry.
2005-11-24T10:54:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	now do the oppposite of what we did, earlier "sudo apt-get remove totem"
2005-11-24T10:54:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	and I'll brb
2005-11-24T10:54:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	and test it
2005-11-24T10:55:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	I was in totam as you types that....
2005-11-24T11:02:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	where do you stand now?
2005-11-24T11:03:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	apt-get fooled me... but I finally got totem removed.
2005-11-24T11:04:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	mplayer still works. but there's no gui controls, BTW
2005-11-24T11:04:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	On a related note... I shoudl tell you something...
2005-11-24T11:05:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	"sudo apt-get install mplayer*" now, with the * at the end of that line, see if you get dep probs
2005-11-24T11:05:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	I bought this laptop about amonth ago. Installed Ubuntu, and *all* my media buttons worked without me touching it!! V+, V-, Mute, >>, << Play/Pause, DVD, Music
2005-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	NOW, only the Volume buttons and "Music" works (Opens RhythmBox)
2005-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	hoary or breezy?
2005-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Breezy
2005-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	but hoary before or always breezy?
2005-11-24T11:06:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	OK, I'll try that apt command
2005-11-24T11:07:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Breezy since the day I brouht it home. never reinstalled breezy either.
2005-11-24T11:07:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Which, like I said... was only a month ago. :)
2005-11-24T11:07:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok, try the command , let me know
2005-11-24T11:08:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Wow, tons of matches and conflists
2005-11-24T11:08:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Last conflict shown: Conflicts: mplayer-custom but 1:1.0-pre5-0.6ubuntu1 is to be installed
2005-11-24T11:08:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	"sudo apt-get remove totem mplayer" all in one line then
2005-11-24T11:09:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	lets start fresh
2005-11-24T11:09:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	heh, ok
2005-11-24T11:09:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Remember, I have mplayer-586 installed, not "mplayer"
2005-11-24T11:09:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	But, ok... that's gone.
2005-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	PMantis	misfit_toy	Should we take this "offline" to a /query?
2005-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	ok so you now have no totem and no mplayer, correct? try each in a terminal
2005-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	misfit_toy	PMantis	sure
