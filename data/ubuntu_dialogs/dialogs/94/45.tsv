2008-12-11T18:33:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	try running it as sudo
2008-12-11T18:34:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	thx
2008-12-11T18:36:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	one of your devices got an IP, just not sure which, whats the output of sudo ifconfig?
2008-12-11T18:37:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	im at the moment connected to wlan0, I think that's the device which got an ip
2008-12-11T18:37:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, and you need eth0 to get an ip as well?
2008-12-11T18:38:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	yep, im currently on wireless and I can't get eth0 to work ... (the network is set to dhcp)
2008-12-11T18:39:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	strange, most have the issue the other way .... have you confirmed the cable is plugged in and good and you have lights on the router showing a connection?
2008-12-11T18:39:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	here's the output http://pastebin.com/d6865afa0
2008-12-11T18:40:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	im currently staying in a hotel so I can't tell if the router's working. However, I got the hotel's IT people to test out the connection and it worked on their XP machine (person brought a XP laptop in to test)
2008-12-11T18:41:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	cable's definitely working and there's light on the port
2008-12-11T18:42:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, something doesnt look right with that send_packet: Message too long part
2008-12-11T18:43:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	mhmm, im new to linux... what can i do to fix this issue?
2008-12-11T18:44:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	looking into it, its new to me as well
2008-12-11T18:44:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	has the wired connection ever worked before?
2008-12-11T18:45:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	it worked at the previous hotel lol
2008-12-11T18:45:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, then to me it sounds like some kind of issue talking to the router here, lets try this gksu gedit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-12-11T18:46:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	then remove interface-mtu
2008-12-11T18:47:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	oh, i thought u wanted the pastebin ... lol here it is anyway http://pastebin.com/d27bef925
2008-12-11T18:47:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	save that file then run sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1000
2008-12-11T18:48:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, line 21, look for that interface-mtu and remove it
2008-12-11T18:48:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	will also need to restart networking
2008-12-11T18:49:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	okay... first, make a backup of the file? Then remove interface-mtu, then run ifconfig eth0 mtu 1000 ???
2008-12-11T18:49:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	lol im scared if i do this, my network won't work again roflmao
2008-12-11T18:49:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	bingo, backup first, remove the line
2008-12-11T18:50:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	okay ... umm how to do a backup ?
2008-12-11T18:50:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	you at least have your wireless that should stay working, besides, if it doesn't, just replace the file
2008-12-11T18:51:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	lol getting the wireless to work is kinda a pain, im using the free unsecured wireless from across the road I fink LOL (probably from a cafe or smth)
2008-12-11T18:51:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	im just in range for it lmao
2008-12-11T18:52:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	to back it up, open a terminal and type sudo cp /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf.back
2008-12-11T18:55:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	i've removed interface-mtu, do i restart networkmanager first?
2008-12-11T18:55:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	not totally sure by the instructions, maybe try it and see if you can connect and if so, don't worry about the other command
2008-12-11T18:57:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	umm so, run 'sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1000' then plug in the cable and disable wireless?
2008-12-11T18:57:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	should be able to leave the wireless connected
2008-12-11T18:58:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	i ran sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1000 and nothing happened
2008-12-11T18:58:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	if i do ifconfig eth0 mtu-1000 it says SIOCSIFADDR: No buffer space available
2008-12-11T18:58:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, now run sudo dhclient eth0
2008-12-11T19:03:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	here u go, took a while http://pastebin.com/d571cb525
2008-12-11T19:03:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	so no further ahead then we were
2008-12-11T19:04:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	ahh ... want to replace the mtu file?
2008-12-11T19:04:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	i mean the back up file? brb in 10mins
2008-12-11T19:05:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	let's replace the original sudo cp /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf.back /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-12-11T19:15:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	back, now what can i do lol
2008-12-11T19:16:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	did you restore the file yet?
2008-12-11T19:16:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	sudo cp /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf.back /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-12-11T19:16:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	yup i did
2008-12-11T19:17:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	nope
2008-12-11T19:17:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, restart the network
2008-12-11T19:17:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	sudo NetworkManager restart?
2008-12-11T19:18:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2008-12-11T19:20:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	yup did that, but got these  * Reconfiguring network interfaces...                                          Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0.
2008-12-11T19:21:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	I've seen that before but can't remember the fix, give me 2
2008-12-11T19:27:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	run gksu gedit /etc/network/run/ifstate and add 'wlan0=wlan0' (without the ' ') then save
2008-12-11T19:29:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	back that file as well?
2008-12-11T19:29:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	probably a good idea
2008-12-11T19:30:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	then run gksu gedit /etc/network/interfaces and add iface wlan0 inet dhcp
2008-12-11T19:31:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	dang, so much for that idea
2008-12-11T19:32:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	lol ...
2008-12-11T19:32:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	skip that part and add ifcae wlan0 inte dhcp?
2008-12-11T19:32:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	yeah
2008-12-11T19:35:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	it now looks like this auto lo
2008-12-11T19:36:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	no mention of eth0?
2008-12-11T19:37:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	that's the whole file after i added "iface wlan0 inet dhcp"
2008-12-11T19:37:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, add another line with eth0 and the same info but changing wlan0 to eth0
2008-12-11T19:38:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	after that??
2008-12-11T19:38:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	yeah
2008-12-11T19:38:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	ah i meant after adding the last line, what do I do next?
2008-12-11T19:40:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	i ran the command sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart and ... nothing happened? LOL
2008-12-11T19:40:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	* Reconfiguring network interfaces...                                   [ OK ]
2008-12-11T19:41:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	ok, check your ip address sudo ifconfig or sudo iwconfig
2008-12-11T19:42:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	here http://pastebin.com/d6d857b1d :D
2008-12-11T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	looks okay, lets try to bring it up sudo dhclient eth0
2008-12-11T19:50:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	here http://pastebin.com/d6d857b1d
2008-12-11T19:50:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	net's slow, sry
2008-12-11T19:51:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	same info as before, what was the output of sudo dhclient eth0 ?
2008-12-11T19:52:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	oops, sry. Lets try that again http://pastebin.com/d2039eb0f
2008-12-11T19:53:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	something screwy there
2008-12-11T19:53:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	yer ... I dunno what's happening ... need to reinstall ??
2008-12-11T19:54:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	I'd hate to go to that extreme since it was working at another location
2008-12-11T19:54:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	yeh ... was working this morning in fact, before I moved to another hotel
2008-12-11T19:55:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	I'd almost think its something with the way their router is configured, if its even a router and not a server on site
2008-12-11T19:58:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	but how would u explain the dhclient ??
2008-12-11T19:59:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	dhclient is your computer and its trying to talk to the router/server
2008-12-11T20:00:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	oo i see, I thought it was trying to simulate a connection and check if ur device works
2008-12-11T20:00:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	no, its actually trying to talk to the router
2008-12-11T20:01:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	well i guess i'll just stick with this wireless then
2008-12-11T20:02:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	I would until you have a chance to test it elsewhere
2008-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	I guess that's the best plan for now
2008-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	thanks for ur help then :D
2008-12-11T20:05:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	no problem man, hope you get it figured out and its still working elsewhere
2008-12-11T20:08:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	but using wireless like this is kinda dangerous as well lol, people can just hack in
2008-12-11T20:09:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	most of the script kiddies wouldn't know what to do even if the could get in
2008-12-11T20:10:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	yeah i guess, but if you can just capture the packets lying around, and if u know what to look for ... its good enough ?? I dunno much about hacking wireless, I have been trying to do it so that I can get some free wireless back where I stay cos its a pain in the ass to register for one/even be willing to pay for it I thought i'll just hack just to keep things simple lol
2008-12-11T20:11:00.000Z	Halitech	giganto	but then you run the risk of getting in trouble ;)
2008-12-11T20:12:00.000Z	giganto	Halitech	lol Im quite save, I know they don't know how to secure their wireless as well
