2006-11-07T15:28:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 keeps the garbage off of the channel.
2006-11-07T15:28:00.000Z	prestosd		anyhow
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	prestosd		what do you think of my results?
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 like I said though, you just need to partition, and mount your drie?
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	prestosd		how do I do that?
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 s/drie/drive
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	prestosd		typing the command......
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 hold on.
2006-11-07T15:29:00.000Z	prestosd		it didnt do  anything
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	prestosd	beetle11011	still waiting.....
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	prestosd		summit?
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	prestosd		what is the summit?
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	prestosd		is that in colorado?
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 partition with cfdisk (cfdisk /dev/hdb), format with mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1, and then mount it (mount /dev/hdb1 /whereever)
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	prestosd		k, ill try that
2006-11-07T15:33:00.000Z	prestosd		when i type cfdisk /dev/hdb it says "FATAL ERROR: Cannot Open Disk Drive"
2006-11-07T15:35:00.000Z	prestosd	beetle11011	are you there? When i type cfdisk /dev/hdb it says "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive"
2006-11-07T15:35:00.000Z	prestosd		ill try.....
2006-11-07T15:36:00.000Z	prestosd		okay, it started
2006-11-07T15:36:00.000Z	prestosd		thanks
2006-11-07T15:37:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 you will need to use sudo on all of those commands
2006-11-07T15:37:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 also, the /whereever is supposed to be wherever you want to mount the filesystem.
2006-11-07T15:39:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 so, for example, you could make a directory under mnt called hdb, and then mount it like "mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb"
2006-11-07T15:39:00.000Z	beetle11011	prestosd	 sorry, "sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/hdb"
