2004-12-02T06:36:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	hmm, isa
2004-12-02T06:39:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	the snd-opl3sa2 should be the right one....
2004-12-02T06:40:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	hmmm but modprobing it says "No such device"
2004-12-02T06:40:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	try loading it after next reboot, i'm not sure the other one got unloaded properly....so it says no such device....its blocked
2004-12-02T06:45:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	u still there?   that modprobe still doesn't work

2004-12-02T06:53:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	any clue?
2004-12-02T06:53:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	i'd like to know where these modules get loaded from .... strange
2004-12-02T06:57:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	still no clue??
2004-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	nope, not really....
2004-12-02T06:59:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	its a bit strange that there are any sond modules....
2004-12-02T07:05:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	april
2004-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	i just looked at modinfo snd-opl3sa2 whoo lots of options....
2004-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	ok... and does it give any clue?
2004-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	i think snd_opl3_lib blocks the device...so your snd-opl3sa2 fails to load
2004-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	there i'm sitll diggin for an idea
2004-12-02T07:13:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	i've unloaded all the sound related modules, and tried to load snd-opl3sa2... but it still says "No such device"
2004-12-02T07:14:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	its the module for  Yamaha OPL3SA2+ which should be in your laptop....
2004-12-02T07:14:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	i don't quite get what you are saying... are you asking me something, or just saying to yourself ??
2004-12-02T07:15:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	i have no idea why you cant load it....
2004-12-02T07:16:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	hmmm....depends:        snd-cs4231-lib,snd-opl3-lib,snd,snd-mpu401-uart,snd-pcm
2004-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	the dependencys are exactly what is loaded after boot....
2004-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	agwibowo	ogra	so you are certain that my sound card is ISA ?
2004-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	yep....
2004-12-02T07:20:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	but ?
2004-12-02T07:21:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	they are dependent to snd-opl3sa2...
2004-12-02T07:22:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	i guess snd-opl3sa2 is also loaded on boot ...thats why they were there before....
2004-12-02T07:22:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	there must be some setting either for the module or a bootoption that will help here
2004-12-02T07:24:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	does your mixer work ?
2004-12-02T07:28:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	xmule is in universe
2004-12-02T07:29:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	not the greatest but does the job
2004-12-02T07:31:00.000Z	ogra	agwibowo	drag
