2006-11-07T16:40:00.000Z	splintax		anyone in that can help me set up the nvidia drivers in ubuntu?
2006-11-07T16:40:00.000Z	splintax		i've been having heaps of trouble with it
2006-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	splintax		argh why is it that at the exact same time that i decide to ask a question someone else comes in and asks first
2006-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	aye.
2006-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	woot first response i've got in here with regard to this question
2006-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	how do you recommend i go about it?
2006-11-07T16:41:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	nvidia.com or what
2006-11-07T16:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	nah all the packages you need are in the repos. do you have the universe repose etc. setup in sources.list?
2006-11-07T16:42:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	haven't edited any text files, but yes, i added the 'universe' repository in synaptic
2006-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	and is the machine you want to set up the one you are typing on?
2006-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	affirmative
2006-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	also do you mind using the command line options?
2006-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	ubuntu install killed my windows install, haven't got around to trying to fix that yet :P
2006-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i am more comfortable with the shell than with the GUI, heh, i've been using bash over SSH for a while but this is my first time using linux on the desktop
2006-11-07T16:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	 probably just grub
2006-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	nope, can "boot" into windows but i think the graphics card dies halfway through the loading process (with the scrolling blue bar and windows XP logo)
2006-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	anyway i'd like to set up the video drivers first because this resolution is friggin' killing my eyes =(
2006-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	can I PM you? this is kinda confusing =(
2006-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	fantastic. i am very cli myself. you should just try wacking it with the nvidia-glx package to start with. should "just work TM". then we can tweak the xorg.conf if needs be.
2006-11-07T16:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	i prefer it in this one window. it's better for you cause other people will but in when i'm wrong ;)
2006-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	ok. sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx gives me "nvidia-glx is already the newest version.
2006-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	which is probably because i've already spent a fair bit of time mucking around with this shit :-(
2006-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	so are you using  the nvidia drivers?
2006-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i don't know. how would i find out?
2006-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	is it just resolution you need?
2006-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	the problem is the resolution, i have a widescreen monitor and can't set it to widescreen resolution.
2006-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	try glxinfo
2006-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i know in windows you can tell if you have the drivers installed or not because the windows are less laggy dragging them around.. certainly the windows aren't lagging when i drag them around but that may just be ubuntu
2006-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	dude.
2006-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	so how can I set the resolution to 1440x900?
2006-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i just assumed it was the drivers. my bad.
2006-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	right. have you set it in your modeline or in the devices section?
2006-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i was using the dialog in preferences or something
2006-11-07T16:49:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	called "Screen Resolution" i think.
2006-11-07T16:49:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	get on down with the 'sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf'  (backup first, always with the backing up)
2006-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	learned that lesson earlier today, tried to edit xorg.conf to setup my G7 (mouse) and i had to restore backup =P
2006-11-07T16:50:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	i only have an mx518 mouse and dual CRT monitors but you can have a look at mine: http://gyaresu.org/xorg.conf
2006-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	is there a way to restart X without rebooting?
2006-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	CTRTL+ALT+BACKSPACE
2006-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	Nope. Just X
2006-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	yes (remember to preface with my name or i won't see you )
2006-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	so can i get the changes to xorg.conf to take effect without rebooting?
2006-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	CTRTL+ALT+BACKSPACE
2006-11-07T16:55:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	/confused okay then.
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	thankyou so much
2006-11-07T16:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	WOO!
2006-11-07T16:58:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	you were using Automatix or somesuch?
2006-11-07T16:59:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	no. Although I did open Evolution, but I didn't set up any mail accounts.
2006-11-07T16:59:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	bleeding edge drivers for nvidia/ati
2006-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	http://albertomilone.com/driver_edgy.html
2006-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	yep, i (attempted to) install that
2006-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	hence key.
2006-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	(correct res is it?)
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	yes <3
2006-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	I'm always amazed when this stuff works.
2006-11-07T17:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	choose different icon set.
2006-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	okay, i'll try.
2006-11-08T11:59:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	'sudo grub-install /dev/otherhdd
2006-11-08T12:00:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	and is there something i need to do to deinstall it from the disk it's currently on
2006-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	no. just make the other drive the first to boot. (you can DD the first 513KB but lets not get into that)
2006-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	how do i know what 'otherhdd' should be? i think it's sda1, but i'm not sure.
2006-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i want to install to the disk that holds the partition linux is currently installed on
2006-11-08T12:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	'fdisk -l'
2006-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	the disk NOT the partition (hda,sda,sdd... whatever)
2006-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	thanks
2006-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	that explains a lot as well
2006-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	your questions are good :)
2006-11-08T12:03:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	so sda means the first SATA, sdb would be the second SATA, and sda1 sda2 and sda3 would be the partitions on sda
2006-11-08T12:03:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	thanks. i do support on other channels for windows and some software, so i know how much of a PITA it is supporting people who can't be arsed learning what they're doing anyway. i'm also a general windows consultant person
2006-11-08T12:14:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i have more questions :P
2006-11-08T12:14:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i was able to get GRUB to come up, but the configuration was incorrect
2006-11-08T12:14:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	are hd0, hd1, hd2 etc. the hard disks in BIOS boot order or what?
2006-11-08T12:14:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i could only boot into ubuntu by changing it to boot into hd0 instead of hd1 as it was set up.
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	you will need to edit your menu.lst (you can just do it on the fly with grub. that's one of the cool things about it)
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	that's how i was able to boot up. i edited it on the fly - however, i wasn't able to get the changes to stay
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	hda hdb yes ide positions.
2006-11-08T12:15:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i had to edit it then press 'b' to boot
2006-11-08T12:16:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	gotta edit menu.lst to make them permanent.
2006-11-08T12:16:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	where can i find menu.lst? and is there another way to edit grub permanently? because when i reboot, it goes back to hd1 where it should be hd0
2006-11-08T12:16:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	ok, so where can i find it?
2006-11-08T12:16:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	'locate -i menu.lst'  (/boot/grub/menu.lst)
2006-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	good question. I always 'grub-install' but someone was saying that you don't need to anymore.
2006-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	So you could just rewrite it then 'grub-install /dev/blah'
2006-11-08T12:21:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	Not sure I understand. If I was to move all the partitions, wouldn't I have to boot into some mini-OS to do so (since the currently-running OS is being moved)? ah but grub would still be on the MBR so i could get into that, then manually edit it to boot into something, then edit menu.lst, correct?
2006-11-08T12:21:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	Shazam!
2006-11-08T12:22:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	(grub is like a little OS)
2006-11-08T12:22:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	okay then. I still have a problem. I think I've edited menu.lst the way I want it. However I still can't boot into windows
2006-11-08T12:23:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	i've spoken to windows people about the problem
2006-11-08T12:23:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	do you know the correct GRUB configuration to boot into windows?
2006-11-08T12:23:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	#windows people say that my problem is likely caused by incorrect bootloader configuration
2006-11-08T12:23:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	 "i've spoken to windows people about the problem" Oh dear god.
2006-11-08T12:24:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	sethk yeah. what he said :)
2006-11-08T12:26:00.000Z	splintax	gyaresu	yes well the windows people warned me that you guys would be yelling at me for various reasons so it seems there's some animosity between the two camps :P
2006-11-08T12:27:00.000Z	gyaresu	splintax	nope. I fix windows for a living for money. I help here for love. You figure it out...
