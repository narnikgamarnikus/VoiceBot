2006-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	rewt_		can linux handle .zip files?
2006-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	rewt_		so how do i install a drive that was in a .zip folder?
2006-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	rewt_		k i extracted it to my desktop
2006-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	rewt_		it has a .exe file?
2006-02-21T10:19:00.000Z	rewt_		can i run those?
2006-02-21T10:20:00.000Z	rewt_		i found a ndiswrapper driver i guess for my card, but the file inside the folder is a .exe
2006-02-21T10:20:00.000Z	rewt_		isnt that fr windows?
2006-02-21T10:21:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	ndiswrapper wraps windows drivers, but the driver should be a .inf
2006-02-21T10:24:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	for which card?
2006-02-21T10:25:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	the 3c410.exe file?
2006-02-21T10:27:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	it is the Broadcom BCM94318 Card. Came with my Presario V2000
2006-02-21T10:27:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	I'm trying to get it working.
2006-02-21T10:28:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	which file though, you gave a page with many
2006-02-21T10:28:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	hit ctrl+f and look for Broadcom BCM94318
2006-02-21T10:28:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	how about pasting in a link to the ACTUAL file
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/notebook/ferrari_4000/driver/winxp64bit/80211g.zip
2006-02-21T10:30:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	that's the zip.  Inside is an .inf.  That's the file you need.
2006-02-21T10:30:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	okay so how do i do it? ive never manually installed something on linux
2006-02-21T10:31:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	you installed ndiswrapper?
2006-02-21T10:31:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	 not yet lemme grab it really fast
2006-02-21T10:31:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	the one you need is "ndiswrapper-utils"
2006-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	 thanks
2006-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	for the -utils part

2006-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	okay, have you extracted the .inf file?
2006-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	do you know how to use the command line?
2006-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	can you change (in the command line) to the directory that you placed the .inf in?
2006-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	okay, let me know when you have
2006-02-21T10:35:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	it's not working

2006-02-21T10:36:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	where did you put the inf?
2006-02-21T10:36:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	okay, type cd ~/Desktop
2006-02-21T10:37:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	then type "cd W" then hit the TAB key, and it will autocomplete
2006-02-21T10:37:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	Okay I typed it and  it opened the dir
2006-02-21T10:38:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	now type "sudo ndiswrapper -i bcmwl5.inf"   When it asks for a password, put YOUR password in.
2006-02-21T10:39:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	Installing bcmwl5
2006-02-21T10:40:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	okay....now you have it installed.  type "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
2006-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	that all i do and it will do rest from there?
2006-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	okay now what
2006-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	did you do that last step?

2006-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	okay....now you have it installed.  type "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
2006-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	that part
2006-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	already did that
2006-02-21T10:44:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	are you online?
2006-02-21T10:44:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	yes but with my external wireless card
2006-02-21T10:45:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	well, type iwconfig and see what you have
2006-02-21T10:45:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	don't paste the output here
2006-02-21T10:45:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	i only see my external on iwconfig
2006-02-21T10:46:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	sec....
2006-02-21T10:48:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	did you get that last message? Only my external is showing up. >.<
2006-02-21T10:48:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	open System > Administration > Networking
2006-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	its open now what
2006-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	do you see both interfaces?
2006-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	Nope only my eth1 which is my orinoco classic gold external
2006-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	hmmm
2006-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	 don't worry, we'll get this figured out
2006-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	cool :)
2006-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	give me a minute or two to look at my other system that's running ndiswrapper
2006-02-21T10:56:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	allright, try this.  Type "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper" in a terminal
2006-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	okay i typed it in
2006-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	anything new in iwconfig?
2006-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	YES!
2006-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	wlan0 is there now
2006-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	great
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	Go into Setting > Administration > Networking, set wlan0 as your Default Gateway, and then you can remove your external
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	will i have to do that everytime i login?
2006-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	 you shouldnt, no.  It should set it up automatically, but if not let me know and we'll work on it more.
2006-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	okay im going to enable this then reboot my computer and see what happens...ill be back in a minute or 5 :-P
2006-02-21T11:02:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	great, I'll keep my fingers crossed
2006-02-21T11:02:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	you and I both. :-P
2006-02-21T11:27:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	sec = second, as in "just a sec"
2006-02-21T11:23:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	Back. :-P
2006-02-21T11:23:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	but you are now running without the external right?
2006-02-21T11:24:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	yes i am but i dont want to have to reconfigre it everytime i boot my machine
2006-02-21T11:24:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	I know, but we've made good progress then
2006-02-21T11:24:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	and if I push my wireless button to turn off the wireless and push it again to turn it back on, it doesnt work, I have to manually reactivate and reconfigure it
2006-02-21T11:25:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	sounds like something hotplug is supposed to be managing.  Is hotplug running?
2006-02-21T11:26:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	sec
2006-02-21T11:27:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	oh okay
2006-02-21T11:27:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	im trying to find that file to edit >.<
2006-02-21T11:28:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	got it.  edit /etc/modules
2006-02-21T11:29:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	but that's not going to fix the button problem
2006-02-21T11:29:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	yep, as a separate line
2006-02-21T11:31:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	okay that's all saved up and ready to go.
2006-02-21T11:31:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	now for the button problem.
2006-02-21T11:32:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	no idea about the button.  I have never had a laptop with internal wireless.  Sorry.
2006-02-21T11:32:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	If you want to send me a laptop with internal wireless, I'd be happy to give it a whirl. ;)
2006-02-21T11:35:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	 you might find something in the forums.
2006-02-21T11:39:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	:(  Well, good luck, I hope you figure it out.  I'm off to bed.
2006-02-21T11:39:00.000Z	rewt_	carpediem	 thanks for all your help :)
2006-02-21T11:40:00.000Z	carpediem	rewt_	np.  Keep at it, and you'll figure it all out, I'm sure.
