2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blazemonger		man ubuntu's frozen up like 3 times when ive tried to run a simple program
2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blazemonger		somethings up
2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blazemonger		and its not my hardware
2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blazemonger		wtf is happening to me?
2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blazemonger		6.10 is buggy
2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	what program?
2006-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	what video card and drivers?
2006-12-27T10:05:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	that's old
2006-12-27T10:05:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	such an old card with such an old driver may very well hve poor 3D support, and since it's loaded into the kernel, it could crash it
2006-12-27T10:06:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	I mean that card is over 10 years old I think
2006-12-27T10:06:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	are you sure that you can boot into Dapper and run the same program with the same driver and not crash?  (please use my nickname so I can find your lines)
2006-12-27T10:07:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	no offense but if you don't type my nick then I'm not going to be able to follow this conversation very well
2006-12-27T10:07:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	the same exact game works PERFECT in windows
2006-12-27T10:07:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	ok, I understand.  But that's a different driver.  Again, are you sure Dapper works perfectly with it?
2006-12-27T10:08:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	what version are you using now?
2006-12-27T10:08:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	im using 6.10 now
2006-12-27T10:08:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	and when did you run it on Dapper?
2006-12-27T10:08:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	right before edgy came out
2006-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	were you using the same video driver?
2006-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	yes i was
2006-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	what driver is that?
2006-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	128
2006-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	r128
2006-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	are there any errors in your syslogs or in ~/.xsession-errors ?
2006-12-27T10:10:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	(gnome-panel:4444): Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_widget_size_allocate(): attempt to alloc
2006-12-27T10:10:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	that's not an error actually, just a warning, and it isn't related to billiard-gl :)
2006-12-27T10:11:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	could it be ubuntu doesnt like my hardware?
2006-12-27T10:11:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	well, it could be a hardware problem.  If you really care, I suggest you file some bug reports.  :)
2006-12-27T10:12:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	are there any 3d apps that don't freeze?
2006-12-27T10:12:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	penguin racer doesnt freeze
2006-12-27T10:12:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	and I know you said it works in Windows, but sometimes Linux handles hardware differently.  My motherboard has a strange IRQ issue that can cause Windows to bluescreen but Linux just boots on and makes a minor complaint
2006-12-27T10:13:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	it does the opposite to me
2006-12-27T10:13:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	all I know to suggest now (other than changing hardware) is to file some bug reports
2006-12-27T10:13:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	ive filed bug reports before but never were fixed
2006-12-27T10:13:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	where did you file them?
2006-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	the apt repositories
2006-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	um...like on what web site?
2006-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	dont know a website
2006-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	...by what method did you file a bug report then?  ...?
2006-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	apt repos are not bug-reporting stations...
2006-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	try www.launchpad.net :)  file some there
2006-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	sounds like a hardware problem to me
2006-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	it's not overclocked, is it?
2006-12-27T10:16:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	is it overheating?
2006-12-27T10:16:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	i dont overclock..could it be i need to reconfigure a kernel?
2006-12-27T10:16:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	that shouldn't be necessary.  maybe it's just that Linux is a bit more stringent with your particular hardware.  again, all I can recommend is to file some bug reports on launchpad
2006-12-27T10:17:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	what do i do if linux is more strigent with my ahrdware?
2006-12-27T10:17:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	get different hardware, or ...file bug reports and help the devs fix the crashes
2006-12-27T10:18:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	I understand...same here
2006-12-27T10:18:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	i do art
2006-12-27T10:18:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	I suggest you look in your syslogs for errors...maybe you can tweak something that's causing a problem
2006-12-27T10:19:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	i dont know how to do that
2006-12-27T10:19:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	sudo less /var/log/syslog, for starters...look at the different log files for things that might be hardware problems in the boot process
2006-12-27T10:20:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	another possibility is to go to the Ubuntu forums and mailing lists and ask there...other folks might have more ideas
2006-12-27T10:21:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	you might try Debian instead of Ubuntu...you never know
2006-12-27T10:21:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	ive tried debian
2006-12-27T10:22:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	try Debian again...it's updated often
2006-12-27T10:22:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	testing
2006-12-27T10:22:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	a rock
2006-12-27T10:26:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	no offense, but if I could offer a suggestion?  :)  Leave this channel, post on the ubuntu forum and on the ubuntu-users list, and go to launchpad.net and file a bug report on billiard-gl and whatever other apps crash.  then wait patiently for answers :)
2006-12-27T10:28:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	are you asking rhetorical questions now?
2006-12-27T10:28:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	methinks you need to look inside yourself for the answers you need :)
2006-12-27T10:29:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	try this: http://linuxfromscratch.org =)
2006-12-27T10:29:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	that onez hard
2006-12-27T10:29:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	maybez zo butz youz learnz lotz
2006-12-27T10:29:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	if I don't hear from you in 5 minutes I'll call 911
2006-12-27T10:30:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	so i have alot to learn about linux? so your'e sure it wouldnt be the kernel?
2006-12-27T10:31:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	no, I'm not sure about anything.  I'm not even at your computer.  I can't help you any more, I'm afraid.  I've already told you my recommendations.  Now the rest is up to you.  :)
2006-12-27T10:31:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	yes, I can't fix it for you, sorry :p
2006-12-27T10:32:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	part of the fun is fixing it yourself.  I just spent 90 minutes getting fuzzyocr to work in SpamAssassin to filter out image spam.  now finally it works!
2006-12-27T10:32:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	you shouldn't trust any system built by someone who says something like that :)
2006-12-27T10:33:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	uh...no...it's a system of Perl modules...not binary stuff...not 3D stuff...not driver stuff...not kernel stuff...so no...not everything crashes, ok!?  :)
2006-12-27T10:33:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	whoa!  why did you suddenly bring up ACPI??
2006-12-27T10:35:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	well, you might try adding something to the kernel boot line...I recommend searching the Ubuntu wiki for info
2006-12-27T10:42:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	now i disab;led acpi and billard-gl either just locks up and sends me back to gdm login
2006-12-27T10:43:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	ok, check the logs for errors
2006-12-27T10:45:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	why do you have PNP disabled?  and what kind of CPU do you have?
2006-12-27T10:45:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	i have a p4
2006-12-27T10:45:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	is pn p supposed to be enabled? i can reboot and enable it again in the bios
2006-12-27T10:46:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	I dunno, try it if you want
2006-12-27T10:46:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	like I said, look in the logs for errors...I already said that but you seem to ignore half of what I suggest :)
2006-12-27T10:46:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	it now just locks up and sends me back to the login screen
2006-12-27T10:46:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	something's probably segfaulting
2006-12-27T10:47:00.000Z	blazemonger	blujay	how can i tell if it's from billard-gl
2006-12-27T10:47:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	for the last time...look in the logs
2006-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	are you using two computers?
2006-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	ok, here's a problem...
2006-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	most likely, when it crashes and restarts gdm, it clears out the ~/.xsession-errors file
2006-12-27T10:51:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	ooh, ooh...look in the X log file
2006-12-27T10:53:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	it looks like this is boiling down to what I said earlier...file a bug report!
2006-12-27T10:54:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	you told me earlier that you didn't actually file a bug report
2006-12-27T10:54:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	go to launchpad.net and FILE A BUG REPORT, please
2006-12-27T10:55:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	sorry, but I'm through with this problem...my last words are, file a bug report.  there's nothing more we can do.
2006-12-27T10:58:00.000Z	blujay	blazemonger	because people like you refuse to help by filing bug reports?
