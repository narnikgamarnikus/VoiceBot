2011-03-05T15:10:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	i think there are vendors that sell Ubuntu DVDs. these have all the packages, so you do not need to download anything
2011-03-05T15:11:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Im in nZ not likely here
2011-03-05T15:12:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	might i ask how you got 10.10?
2011-03-05T15:25:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	No it has eth0 and l0 only
2011-03-05T15:13:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	how does the LiveCD hold? does that also give you problems?
2011-03-05T15:14:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Yes I cant connect to my wireless at all. Says device not ready
2011-03-05T15:15:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	and your WiFi card is enabled using the switch on the keyboard? i think there's a command to enable the device...
2011-03-05T15:16:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	sudo ifdown --force wlan0
2011-03-05T15:17:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	then - sudo ifup --force wlan0
2011-03-05T15:17:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	assuming that the WiFi interface is called wlan0
2011-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	have you tried the commands that i gave you. in the terminal
2011-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Says interface force not configured interface WLAN not configured
2011-03-05T15:24:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	first type - ifconfig
2011-03-05T15:24:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	do you see your WiFi card there?
2011-03-05T15:26:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	hmmm...so your WiFi is not being detected. is it possible for you to connect to your router via a wired connection, temporarily
2011-03-05T15:27:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Yes if i must then what do i do
2011-03-05T15:28:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	update
2011-03-05T15:28:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	And if there is none or doesnt show any
2011-03-05T15:29:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	you should also run this command just in case - sudo dkpg --configure -a
2011-03-05T15:29:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	I am plugged in but not for long now what
2011-03-05T15:30:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	there will be. you have 10.10 which came in the .iso. There have been tons of updates after that. also, during the install, you were probably unable to install the non-free drivers for your WiFi card. that should also be done
2011-03-05T15:30:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	sudo dpkg --configure -a
2011-03-05T15:31:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	How i check for updates

2011-03-05T16:01:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Faild to Download
2011-03-05T16:02:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-2.6.35-22-generic
2011-03-05T16:03:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	assuming that's the name of the drivers that you were trying to install
2011-03-05T16:04:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Failed to fetch. It cant find it on the server
2011-03-05T16:05:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	ping google.com

2011-03-05T16:11:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	It now says wireless is disabled and won't let me enable it. Doesn't say device not ready though as it was
2011-03-05T16:11:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	ifconfig
2011-03-05T16:11:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	does it list wlan0?
2011-03-05T16:12:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Now its enabled and says device not ready again Grr
2011-03-05T16:12:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	Still no wlan0
2011-03-05T16:14:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	No wlan0
2011-03-05T16:14:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	ok. wait
2011-03-05T16:19:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	I have win 7 working on it now dual booting. Well in 5 I will
2011-03-05T16:24:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	if you have internet connected when you install Ubuntu, then almost everything is setup automatically (most of the times), including the WiFi cards
2011-03-05T16:25:00.000Z	Fwb2700	rigved	I couldn't at time. I have win 7 installed just now. And it's working fine on wifi no updates
2011-03-05T16:27:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	it's using the generic wifi drivers that come with it. Ubuntu also has drivers for your latop - ath5k and ath9k, you just need to download and install them. this is done automatically during the install if you have the internet enabled
2011-03-05T16:28:00.000Z	rigved	Fwb2700	charge your laptop fully and then connect it to the internet. then install Ubuntu.
