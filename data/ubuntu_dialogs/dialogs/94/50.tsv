2008-08-22T00:28:00.000Z	balz		how do i check who owns a directory with the command line?
2008-08-22T00:28:00.000Z	unop	balz	ls -ld directory
2008-08-22T00:29:00.000Z	unop	balz	or more accurately.   stat -c '%G' /path/to/directory
2008-08-22T00:30:00.000Z	balz	unop	 thanks
2008-08-22T00:32:00.000Z	unop	balz	what is the path of this directory?
2008-08-22T00:32:00.000Z	unop	balz	which group owns this directory?
2008-08-22T00:32:00.000Z	unop	balz	group?
2008-08-22T00:33:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i'm guessing mythtv?  I'm getting this for all subdirs:  drwxrws--- (number) mythtv mythtv (number 2008-08-20 20:28
2008-08-22T00:33:00.000Z	unop	balz	add your user to the mythtv group then
2008-08-22T00:34:00.000Z	balz	unop	 how do I do that via command line?
2008-08-22T00:34:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i'm sshed in
2008-08-22T00:34:00.000Z	unop	balz	sudo adduser $USER mythtv
2008-08-22T00:35:00.000Z	balz	unop	it says that my user is already a member of "mythtv"
2008-08-22T00:36:00.000Z	unop	balz	what does   groups  return?
2008-08-22T00:38:00.000Z	balz	unop	 groups returns:  louis adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev fuse mythtv admin lpadmin
2008-08-22T00:38:00.000Z	unop	balz	what exactly happens when you try and write to the directory then?
2008-08-22T00:39:00.000Z	balz	unop	 well i'm trying to get mt-daapd to scan the directory recursively and it keeps failing so i ran mt-daapd -f and it gave me opendir:  Permission denied for each subdirectory
2008-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	unop	balz	does the group mythtv have read/write permissions on each of the subdirs?
2008-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	balz	unop	 how do i check? forgive my n00bness
2008-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	unop	balz	ls -ld ,...
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i tried on one of the subdirectories and got this:  drwxrws--- 8 mythtv mythtv 48 2008-08-20 20:28 /var/lib/mythtv/music/Zebrahead
2008-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	unop	balz	just to make sure -- log out and log back in
2008-08-22T00:45:00.000Z	balz	unop	 ok logged back in
2008-08-22T00:46:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i'm sshed in, so i just need to close that session and start a new one, right?  that counts as log out/in?
2008-08-22T00:47:00.000Z	unop	balz	i suppose .. try creating a file in one of those dirs.
2008-08-22T00:48:00.000Z	unop	balz	that gives everyone in the world write access - which is unnecessary
2008-08-22T00:49:00.000Z	balz	unop	 is there a way to do that just for user "louis" ?
2008-08-22T00:49:00.000Z	balz	unop	 actually i just tried making a directory and it worked...
2008-08-22T00:50:00.000Z	unop	balz	i don't see why your command fails
2008-08-22T00:50:00.000Z	balz	unop	 yeah it's weird
2008-08-22T00:50:00.000Z	unop	balz	is that user a member of the mythtv group ?
2008-08-22T00:50:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i believe so
2008-08-22T00:50:00.000Z	balz	unop	 how do i check?
2008-08-22T00:50:00.000Z	unop	balz	groups username  i think
2008-08-22T00:51:00.000Z	unop	balz	log on as that user and try creating a file in one of those dirs
2008-08-22T00:51:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i did. it works
2008-08-22T00:52:00.000Z	unop	balz	hmm, very strange.  did you recently add this user to the mythtv group .. or was it setup that way?
2008-08-22T00:53:00.000Z	unop	balz	actually .. what is this command, and how are you invoking it?
2008-08-22T00:54:00.000Z	balz	unop	 the mt-daapd -f command?  I got it from a forum because i was having problems with getting a music share up.  it seems as though ti gives real time output and error messages
2008-08-22T00:55:00.000Z	unop	balz	so how exactly are you calling this command and what kind of error messages do you get?  use the pastebin and show us an excerpt .. maybe the problem is beyond permissions?
2008-08-22T00:56:00.000Z	balz	unop	 before I do.  there's a runas parameter in the config file whose value is mt-daapd ... i don't have such a user, coudl that be the problem?
2008-08-22T00:56:00.000Z	unop	balz	it sure could .. but i can't speak for how mythtv is designed
2008-08-22T00:57:00.000Z	unop	balz	you could change that to reflect an actual user on the system
2008-08-22T00:57:00.000Z	balz	unop	 let me try that, then i actually have to run.  thanks so much for the help though
2008-08-22T00:57:00.000Z	balz	unop	 yeah that's what i'm going to try real quick
2008-08-24T00:57:00.000Z	unop	balz	you should tell us how it fails
2008-08-24T00:57:00.000Z	balz	unop	 oh right ... lol
2008-08-24T00:58:00.000Z	balz	unop	 louis@server:~$ wget -q http://keyserver.ubuntu.com11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x590BCD51DfC2AFC1 | sudo apt-key add -
2008-08-24T00:59:00.000Z	unop	balz	does that look like a valid URL to you?
2008-08-24T00:59:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i copied it from a website... what am i missing (i know it's obvious...)
2008-08-24T01:00:00.000Z	unop	balz	no ..  http://keyserver.ubuntu.com11371  .. does not appear to be a valid domain
2008-08-24T01:00:00.000Z	unop	balz	what is the key that apt is complaining about .. it might be possible to get it from anothe rkey server
2008-08-24T01:01:00.000Z	balz	unop	 it's the badgerports key
2008-08-24T01:01:00.000Z	balz	unop	 when i click on the lin, i get to the gpg block though.
2008-08-24T01:01:00.000Z	unop	balz	can you pastebin the output of  apt-get update
2008-08-24T01:03:00.000Z	balz	unop	 my pastebin post is tripping their spam filters (wtf?)
2008-08-24T01:03:00.000Z	unop	balz	which pastebin?
2008-08-24T01:05:00.000Z	balz	unop	 got it!  okay

2008-08-24T01:20:00.000Z	balz	unop	 did you get that last bit?  i didn't get an output from that command
2008-08-24T01:20:00.000Z	unop	balz	yea, funny it ain't working.  what's the command you used initially?
2008-08-24T01:21:00.000Z	unop	balz	ok, what's the url tho?
2008-08-24T01:22:00.000Z	balz	unop	sorry:  http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x590BCD51DFC2AFC1

2008-08-24T01:27:00.000Z	unop	balz	ok, gimme a sec.

2008-08-24T01:31:00.000Z	balz	unop	 scratch that
2008-08-24T01:32:00.000Z	balz	unop	 i copied the "balz, " part of your message... i'm jsuch a dipstick sometimes.  looks like it worked. thanks!
2008-08-24T01:32:00.000Z	balz	unop	 do you know what went wrong, just out of curiosity/
2008-08-24T01:32:00.000Z	unop	balz	try apt-get update again .. see if you get the warning at the end
2008-08-24T01:32:00.000Z	balz	unop	 no warning
2008-08-24T01:32:00.000Z	unop	balz	all is good then.
2008-09-09T20:54:00.000Z	unop	balz	as long as you can ping the other host.  shh user@hostname
2008-09-09T20:55:00.000Z	balz	unop	 don't i need to define the IP address?  i'm on a separate network
2008-09-09T20:55:00.000Z	unop	balz	depends .. if the hostname resolves to the correct IP address, you can use the hostname
2008-09-09T20:56:00.000Z	unop	balz	is your router setup to forward ssh traffic to your machine?
2008-09-09T20:56:00.000Z	balz	unop	yes i opened port 22 for the specific machine's hostname
2008-09-09T20:56:00.000Z	unop	balz	then you should just be able to ssh to the router's IP address
2008-09-09T20:57:00.000Z	unop	balz	right, the router is setup to forward traffic with a destination port of 22 ..
2008-09-09T20:58:00.000Z	balz	unop	 riiight... i thought you might have to specify external IP *and* hostname
2008-09-09T20:58:00.000Z	balz	unop	 what if i there are two different computers that i might want to ssh into?
2008-09-09T20:58:00.000Z	unop	balz	you'd have to setup the router to forward at two different ports
2008-09-09T20:59:00.000Z	unop	balz	then you connect to the router at the port you want
2008-09-09T21:00:00.000Z	unop	balz	as long as the first machine knows of 'hostname'
2008-11-03T09:23:00.000Z	unop	balz	hema, don't suggest that (and it's wrong)
2008-11-03T09:23:00.000Z	balz	unop	 oh is it chmod 777 /path ?
2008-11-03T09:24:00.000Z	unop	balz	yes, but there's a better way of getting write access to the directory without relaxing the permissions so much
2008-11-03T09:24:00.000Z	balz	unop	 gotcha. yeah i havent messed with permissions in a while lol
