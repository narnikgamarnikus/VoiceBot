2009-10-05T18:41:00.000Z	CHESLYN		hi guys !!
2009-10-05T18:42:00.000Z	CHESLYN		can anyone help , i try 2 open gksudo they ask me 4 a passwd how can i crack it or reset it
2009-10-05T18:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	is your own password
2009-10-05T18:46:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	i did'nt set a passwd becoze its not my user passwd
2009-10-05T18:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	sudo and gksudo ask for the current users password. just type the password you use to login in your computer
2009-10-05T18:56:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	it shows me i'm not allowed 2 run this program i must contact the administrator so can i change something
2009-10-05T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	 maybe your user is not admin ? did you set up the ubuntu install or someone else did it for you ?
2009-10-05T18:58:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	someone else
2009-10-05T18:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	maybe he/she did not give you the ability to use sudo or gksudo... you have to ask him/her
2009-10-05T19:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	if that is not possible there is a simple way to give your user the power of sudo provided you can reboot your computer
2009-10-05T19:01:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	maybe but cant i change something to have access or reset it
2009-10-05T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	as i said there is a way. reboot into recovery mode (an option in the bootloader menu) drop to a root shell. execute this command « adduser <yourusernamehere> admin » . finally reboot « shutdown -r now »
2009-10-05T19:05:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	like format the all computer
2009-10-05T19:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	no need to reformat all computer follow the steps i just have given to you
2009-10-05T19:06:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	thanks let me try it
2009-10-05T19:28:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	i did what you said but no lak must i command every thing until << stutdown -r now >>
2009-10-05T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	the only commands you have to run are those two « adduser <yourusernamehere> admin » and « stutdown -r now »
2009-10-05T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	do not type the «» i use them to make clear what are the commands and what is not
2009-10-05T19:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	you have to type your actual username (the one you use for login instead of <yourusernamehere>
2009-10-05T19:32:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	like adduser/username/admin/finally reboot/shutdown -r now/
2009-10-05T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	no they are two commands on « adduser <yourusernamehere> admin » then hit enter then the other one
2009-10-05T19:34:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	thanks bra
2009-10-05T19:53:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	sorry but you confuse me now what symbol must i use 4 the << you said i must not use them.what symbols please ?
2009-10-05T19:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	d o not use anything just put what is inside them
2009-10-05T19:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	adduser <yourusername> admin
2009-10-05T19:55:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	thanks oh

2009-10-06T10:52:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	i have a problem that you will sort out
2009-10-21T18:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	you can use gparted if you want GUI app
2009-10-21T18:27:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	if i apt-get gparted they ask me i'm i ''root'' whats wrong
2009-10-21T18:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	use « sudo aptitude install gparted »
2009-10-21T18:31:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	after yhat how do i format the USB?
2009-10-21T18:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	run system>admin>parition/disk editor
2009-10-21T18:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	should be pretty intutive ... you choose the disk in the top right corner drop down menu. then right click on the bar
2009-10-21T18:41:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	i don't understand
2009-10-21T18:44:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	that command you give me system>admin>parition/disk editor does not work in terminal
2009-10-21T18:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	you do not have a graphical interface ?
2009-10-21T18:45:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	what do tou mean?
2009-10-21T18:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	i'm asking if you are running an Xserver if you have gui
2009-10-21T18:48:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	i'm running Xserver
2009-10-21T18:49:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	so there is no other way to format it
2009-10-21T18:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	ohh sorry i know what you meant System>Admin>parition/disk editor is the menu where you can find gparted not a command
2009-10-21T18:53:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	ok i'll try lol i can believe i'm struggling to format i USB thanks
2009-10-21T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	i agree that it should be easier that it currently is.
2009-10-21T18:57:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	ok can you just explain me from start like perhaps we never had this confusion please thanks alot
2009-10-21T18:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	you have gparted installed ? are you using ubuntu ? then Go to the menu System>Admin>parition editor to launch gparted (it will ask your password)
2009-10-21T18:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	once in gparted it should be pretty easy to do what you want
2009-10-21T19:08:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	I dont see admin in menu system>
2009-10-21T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	are you using default ubuntu or are you using kubuntu / xubuntu ??
2009-10-21T19:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	is maybe Administration ?
2009-10-21T19:09:00.000Z	CHESLYN	erUSUL	ok now how?

2009-10-21T19:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	CHESLYN	you should read something like [ /dev/sd(a,b,c) Size ]
