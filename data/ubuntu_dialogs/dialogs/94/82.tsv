2007-01-21T17:45:00.000Z	SecrethX		hmm.. somehow I managed to change my startup screen :P where can I change it back to normal?
2007-01-21T17:46:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	your startup screen? you mean the splash, or the login screen?
2007-01-21T17:58:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 my Login screen has a freaky resolution ;P (yes its a custom one)
2007-01-21T17:59:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	hmm, tell me the screen resolution and look at your Xorg.conf
2007-01-21T06:02:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 I dont know the resolution but it is tall and small.. so would be like 1440x900 (that one is in my xorg.conf among with others)
2007-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	well, remove that res from xorg.conf if you like
2007-01-21T06:04:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I did remove them, now I have this: "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
2007-01-21T06:05:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	your login screen will be restricted to those then
2007-01-21T06:05:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	okay :)
2007-01-21T06:07:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	ill reboot and try it
2007-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	still the same :s
2007-01-21T06:10:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	very strange. your monitor should tell you the res on its menu..
2007-01-21T06:11:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	*slaps himself, why didnt I think about that!*
2007-01-21T06:11:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	ill reboot in a minute, first gotta do something
2007-01-21T06:15:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	its 1600x1200
2007-01-21T06:16:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	odd, very odd. I suggest you check the "make global default" thing in the resolution selector
2007-01-21T06:16:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	already tried that.. didnt help
2007-01-21T06:17:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	could it have something to do with XGL being installed?
2007-01-21T06:18:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yes, yes it could. get rid of XGL as much as possible
2007-01-21T06:18:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	will do
2007-01-21T06:19:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	there is no reason to use XGL, as it's much worse than XAIGL which is provided in edgy
2007-01-21T06:19:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I saw XGL in my 'sessions' list on the logon screen, but in Synaptic I search for XGL and nothing is installed :S
2007-01-21T06:20:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	verry strainge
2007-01-21T06:22:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 even more weird, beryl also says XGL is absent.. so where does it come from in my login screen? :s
2007-01-21T06:22:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	I have no idea. final thing: fiddle with your GDM config files, wherever they are
2007-01-21T06:24:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 where are those config files? :P
2007-01-21T06:25:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	I have no idea. /etc is a good place to start, though
2007-01-21T06:25:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	ill let you know when I find them
2007-01-21T06:28:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	found it; /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom (if the -custom is present, it will be using that file, of not then gdm.conf) but there is nothing in it with "resolution"
2007-01-21T06:30:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	just nevermind it ;P ill set it to login within 5 seconds so I barely even notice it.. wanna hear my other problem? :P
2007-01-21T06:30:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yeah, go on
2007-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 I have a 5.1 card, 5.1 boxes, plugged them in right and I still cant get more than 2 boxes to work :P
2007-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	again, fiddle with volume controls :)
2007-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 already done that (alsamixergui)
2007-01-21T06:32:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	try GNOME's builtin one
2007-01-21T06:32:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	which is? :o
2007-01-21T06:32:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	double-click the little speaker icon on your panel
2007-01-21T06:33:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	why didnt I think of that!!! darn :P
2007-01-21T06:34:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I probably could, but I need to look into xchats plugin stuff then
2007-01-21T06:34:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	it doesn't have one
2007-01-21T06:34:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I know, I ment the system that loads it :) what do you wanna do?
2007-01-21T06:35:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	what command do you wanna add? :s
2007-01-21T06:36:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	I want it to type "/me pings bell\nanyone not being served" when I type "/pingbell"
2007-01-21T06:36:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	okay will try to make it :)
2007-01-21T06:48:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	any progress on my meme shortcut? x-)
2007-01-21T06:48:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	im trying ;P never tried something like this for XChat
2007-01-21T06:48:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	cheers for the whole thing
2007-01-21T06:50:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yay! thanks
2007-01-21T06:50:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	I shall hack it appropriately
2007-01-21T06:51:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	sudo gedit ~/.xchat/pingbell.pl
2007-01-21T06:51:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I know, one of my bad habits ;O
2007-01-21T06:53:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	saw your pm?
2007-01-21T06:54:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	please do it again, sorry
2007-01-21T06:55:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	after you save it
2007-01-21T06:57:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	my bad, xchat2
2007-01-21T06:59:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	its actually quite easy if you know it ;O
2007-01-21T07:02:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I love you
2007-01-21T07:02:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	excellent
2007-01-21T07:02:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I added every option and set it to maximum now my boxes work :D
2007-01-21T07:03:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yay
2007-01-21T07:05:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	do you know something about beryl? :o
2007-01-21T07:05:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yeah, I know it's a nice toy for about five minutes
2007-01-21T07:06:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	lol I just cant get it to work, always says "beryl: No composite extension"
2007-01-21T07:08:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I found out that Composite was disabled in xorg.conf ;P brb X reboot :)
2007-01-21T07:17:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	im already sick and tired of beryl and I didnt even get it to work..
2007-01-21T07:17:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	just avoid it
2007-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	it just looked so cool ^^
2007-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	until at least feisty+1
2007-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 ok :P
2007-01-22T13:29:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	wai?
2007-01-22T13:36:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I managed to break xorg :)
2007-01-22T13:37:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	well done, your initiation into the linux hacker circle is complete
2007-01-22T13:37:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	LOL :p
2007-01-22T13:47:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I got it back, but its all fucked up :/ do you know something for reinstalling/reconfiguring it?
2007-01-22T13:47:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-server
2007-01-22T13:59:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	metacity isn't loading, you need to reverse the part of whatever guide you used to set GDM to beryl
2007-01-22T14:00:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	thats the point, I explicitly didnt use the commands that would do stuff like this, so I could do it myself manually
2007-01-22T14:00:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	well, change GDM back to metacity then
2007-01-22T14:00:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	I didnt change it at all.. as a matter of fact, I dont even know what the hell gdm is =o
2007-01-22T14:01:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	it's the login screen program. it's responsible for launching metacity/beryl
2007-01-22T14:01:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	at some point you affected it in some way to make it launch beryl instead of metacity... now you need to reduce this
2007-01-22T14:01:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	is there any file I could edit ?
2007-01-22T14:02:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yes, whatever files you edited before :P sorry
2007-01-22T14:02:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	 lol :P
2007-01-22T14:02:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	ill try to start x in recovery mode so I can access my bookmarks..
2007-01-22T14:10:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	yay
2007-01-22T14:10:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	but not in real mode ;P
2007-01-22T14:12:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	fraid not, I'm in the middle of a syllable review atm
2007-01-22T14:12:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	oh have fun, lol
2007-01-22T14:13:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	trying normal mode now, I reversed everything on that site
2007-01-22T14:14:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	ok
2007-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	im never ever gonna use beryl again :/
2007-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	SecrethX	goodgerster	metacity still isnt loaded :x
2007-01-22T14:18:00.000Z	goodgerster	SecrethX	good idea
