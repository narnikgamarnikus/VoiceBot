2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	anything else I could try....I did try removing firefox and it still appears
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	uh, removing firefox? how?
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	apt-get
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	what does 'which firefox' return?
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	/usr/bin/firefox
2008-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	ls -l /usr/bin/firefox
2008-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 2008-06-18 17:33 /usr/bin/firefox -> /opt/firefox/firefox
2008-11-02T01:59:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	Do you know anything about why you have firefox installed in /opt?
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	I think I may have installed it manually when firefox 3 came out and then upgrade to 8.04 and now 8.10
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	that was a while ago
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	can I get it out and just ued the apt-get version
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	that's the reason your flash is not working.  You aren't using the package manager's firefox
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	try reinstalling firefox
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	that makes sense
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	I tried but it does not seem to pick it up
2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	in particular, the firefox-3.0 package
2008-11-02T02:01:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	how can I get rid of the one in opt
2008-11-02T02:01:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	let's get the apt one working first so we make sure you have a browser :)
2008-11-02T02:02:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	ok I have installed it again
2008-11-02T02:02:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	how do I run it
2008-11-02T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	ls -l /usr/bin/firefox   returns what now?
2008-11-02T02:02:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 2008-06-18 17:33 /usr/bin/firefox -> /opt/firefox/firefox
2008-11-02T02:03:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	ok.  Try running 'firefox-3.0'
2008-11-02T02:04:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	 this is what I see on you tube    Hello, you either have JavaScript turned off or an old version of Adobe's Flash Player. Get the latest Flash player.

2008-11-02T02:06:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	there is and it does not run through automatic update
2008-11-02T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	what do you mean by "it does not run through automatic update"?
2008-11-02T02:06:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	it does not find it automatically...it points me to download manually and install
2008-11-02T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	meh, ok.  Let's get rid of your /opt install first then.  Close firefox.  Run 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install firefox-3.0'.  Then tell me what 'ls -l /usr/bin/firefox' returns
2008-11-02T02:09:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	 k its working now

2008-11-02T02:13:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	local diversion of /usr/bin/firefox to /usr/bin/firefox.ubuntu
2008-11-02T02:13:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	do this: sudo rm /usr/bin/firefox && sudo dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/bin/firefox
2008-11-02T02:14:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	ok and...

2008-11-02T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	just use ubuntu as my main os and try out interesting stuff when I see it :)
2008-11-02T17:32:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	 thou I can recieve with sendmail

2008-11-02T17:36:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	On my home machine, I use esmtp, so it just uses an smtp server somewhere else
2008-11-02T17:36:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	thanks I will take a look at it...I am frustrated with my knowledge of tcp/ip and I think that is where the sendmail is not confitured proeprly it's part of the LPI certification
2011-11-18T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	you could install 12.04 in virtualbox
2011-11-18T06:55:00.000Z	aaron	jrib	what if the bugs were in 11.04 and have not gotten fixed yet
2011-11-18T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	aaron	how would you know if it's the same cause :)
