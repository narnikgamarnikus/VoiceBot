2009-03-01T13:44:00.000Z	Squynti		no one seem to understand myproblem?
2009-03-01T13:45:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	i kinda understand your problem but messing with boot tables can be very messy (especially across irc)
2009-03-01T13:46:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	is it that grub can't boot windows anymore?
2009-03-01T13:46:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	ok i appreciate if you helpme as I'll be careful and I can explain to you  as much depth as I can s'alrite with you?
2009-03-01T13:46:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	actually i do see grub prompt
2009-03-01T13:47:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	when the computer first starts up?  do you see any choices?
2009-03-01T13:48:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	do you mean boot menu? windows -> ubuntu? yes
2009-03-01T13:48:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	and what happens for each?
2009-03-01T13:54:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	could you do me a favour and start any responses directed at my with my Handle typeing "Zy" then pressing tab might autocomplete it
2009-03-01T13:56:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	that grub error about error 15 usually means that it can't see even your root partion, if you boot off the live cd can you see both partitons
2009-03-01T13:57:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	actually Im not too sure of the last part whatyou said... but im  goin to assume that I dont see it because I dont know of it
2009-03-01T13:58:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	also I'd have to assume that ubuntu had hidden my windows partition somehow??
2009-03-01T13:58:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	just so i'm clear - can you boot into windows right now?
2009-03-01T13:58:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	no
2009-03-01T13:59:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	i've never heard of hidden partition really.  can you get into ubuntu right now then?
2009-03-01T13:59:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	as I mentioned i received the windows error : autochk program not found skipping autocheck
2009-03-01T13:59:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	and ubuntu can you get into it?
2009-03-01T13:59:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	technically I can go into ubuntu but only at grub prompt
2009-03-01T14:00:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	so that's really a no unfortunatly.  you have no working os to actually make any changes, except the grub prompt - so we need to make it boot into something.
2009-03-01T14:01:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	so what am I to do now?
2009-03-01T14:02:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	there is a way to edit the lines in grub so we can try poining it to different drives, hold one sec
2009-03-01T14:03:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	are you or can you get to your grub prompt?
2009-03-01T14:03:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	I searched the web about autochk issue and said it had been hidden somehow for my case from ubuntu cuz I accidently messed something up... forgot what command I made it happen cuz I got into windows just fine while ubuntu installed
2009-03-01T14:04:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	are you at the grub menu?
2009-03-01T14:04:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	uhm actually im in some kind of find lines in there so I guess I wud say yes for grub prompt
2009-03-01T14:05:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	ummm, not entirely sure what you mean....  do you see choices like "Ubuntu 8.xx ..." and Windows?
2009-03-01T14:06:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	Im in grub prompt there right now...
2009-03-01T14:06:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	grub prompt? does your prompt look like a > , what do you see?
2009-03-01T14:07:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	right now grub>_
2009-03-01T14:07:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	OK, you really are at a grub prompt!
2009-03-01T14:07:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	yes apparently so
2009-03-01T14:09:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	but you shouldn't really see this?  and this is why helping you in this mater is so difficult - I can't see what your seeing and I don't want to mess up your paritions...  but grub is very messed up right now for you.
2009-03-01T14:10:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	shouldn't see this what?  at least what you have totell me and I ll consider the risk ok?
2009-03-01T14:11:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	and not to worry I can't sue you for this lol
2009-03-01T14:11:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	give me a sec... reading
2009-03-01T14:11:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	care to share it?
2009-03-01T14:12:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	ok, your right, i should say searching instead of reading :)

2009-03-01T14:21:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	no usb that is
2009-03-01T14:22:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	ok so is your boot order not set to automatically boot from cd then?  if it isn't then lets just start the livecd like boot off the cdrom.
2009-03-01T14:24:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	ah, why didnt i think of that... let me try this
2009-03-01T14:26:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	invaild system disk error
2009-03-01T14:27:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	disregard that
2009-03-01T14:27:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	? "invalid system disk" tell me you have a floppy disk drive?
2009-03-01T14:27:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	I changed the boot process to cd at top (first) but at no go as itseemed
2009-03-01T14:28:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	are u sure that's a livecd?
2009-03-01T14:30:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	that what it says on the cd...
2009-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	where you able to boot off this same cd to install from???  i'll brb, but i gotta take the dog for a walk.
2009-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	where or were?
2009-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	Im guessing its were...and yea i have two cd drives and I know which one I used it install it
2009-03-01T14:34:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	Ok, I had to manually boot into the Cd and Im in the install window on its own...
2009-03-01T14:41:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	you still there?  are you at the desktop of the livecd?
2009-03-01T14:42:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	Im still here and Now I understand what am I gonna do, thanks toyou as im in the partition dialog box atthe moment....but Im considering aborting it so I can fix the next problem
2009-03-01T14:43:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	should i ask?  what is "the next" problem?
2009-03-01T14:44:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	You don't have to haha but I want my windows back and I'd guess you wudnt helpme with this one/
2009-03-01T14:44:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	also is this a live cd or an install cd?
2009-03-01T14:45:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	livecd give you an ubuntu desktop, install cds just give you an install
2009-03-01T14:46:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	cause i really wanted a live cd, not to restart the install in anyway, but there are tools we can use on the livecd
2009-03-01T14:46:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	lety me verify it
2009-03-01T14:47:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	do you see icons? and the "Applications / Places / System" menu at the top?
2009-03-01T14:47:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	it seem says liveCD
2009-03-01T14:48:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	what does the cd say on it?  is this an ubuntu cd?
2009-03-01T14:48:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	what version?
2009-03-01T14:49:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	8.04 and yes its ubuntu... why else I be in this channel? =-)
2009-03-01T14:50:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	just making sure.  i don't remember the cd bringing up the partition dialogure right away though???
2009-03-01T14:51:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	not right away actually its a seven part installation as im in 4th of the 7
2009-03-01T14:51:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	did you start the install after the cd started?
2009-03-01T14:52:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	i guess so after startin from the "liveCD"
2009-03-01T14:52:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	like the cd started and you clicked an icon on the desktop like "install ubuntu"???
2009-03-01T14:53:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	yessir it seemed so I did
2009-03-01T14:56:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	Lincid i certainly didn't mean for you to start the install again, all i wanted to do was start off the livecd and see if ubuntu can see any of your partitions - as your grub is pointing either to the wrong drive/partition - or your partitions have been deleted or corrupted or something..........
2009-03-01T14:58:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	actually my problem are being resolved acording to you (again thank ya!) and as Im considering of aborting it so that I can focus on windows bvecause I have my works info on that partition that I need it back so i can back it up jus in case I'd [BEEP] it up!!
2009-03-01T14:59:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	im tired too as well LOL been atthis since 11 30!! guess we're about to be done eh?
2009-03-01T14:59:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	i don't think your problem is solved at all!  you can't book into windows or ubuntu, and we haven't really been able to use the livecd at all either
2009-03-01T15:00:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	true but
2009-03-01T15:00:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	itsnotmuch of a problem now as I know what and how to boot it in from live cd so called so now I wont have to worry as I understand it better now....
2009-03-01T15:01:00.000Z	Zykotic-K9	Squynti	BEST of luck with your issue -- but I believe your grub is pointing to the wrong places!  Sorry I wasn't able to help you through it.
2009-03-01T15:02:00.000Z	Squynti	Zykotic-K9	hm, from what I see here I doubt that Iam as imnot in grub now... as it lookslike it asit has awindow loaded fromthe cd (partition table) 4th of 7
