2010-02-15T22:31:00.000Z	Pianoman13		is it possible for a new user like me to set a wireless network in Ubuntu 9.10?
2010-02-15T22:31:00.000Z	Pianoman13		i already have a dual boot system Ubuntu and Vista
2010-02-15T22:32:00.000Z	Pianoman13		but my network and wireless do not work in Ubuntu
2010-02-15T22:33:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	try network manager : apt-get install network-manager
2010-02-15T22:35:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	dont forget to sudo it : sudo apt-get install network-manager, you can list available packages for a front end using : sudo apt-cache search network-manager
2010-02-15T22:39:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	now you can configure it by right clicking it -> "edit connections" -> Wireless tab -> Add -> IPv4 settings ... and you should be ok :)
2010-02-15T22:41:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	activate your wireless (in case you have to switch a button on/off) than reboot
2010-02-15T22:47:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	i suppose you're using Gnome, go to System -> Preferences -> Network connections -> click on Wireless tab -> click Add -> go to IPv4 settings
2010-02-15T22:48:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	have a web browser handy and a terminal to test if it's not already connected!
2010-02-15T22:51:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	no, do you know if your modem is using dhcp? cause i assumed you have to configure your connection parameters manually
2010-02-15T22:53:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	well, open a terminal and ping google.com than waitt 5sec and abort using key combination Ctrl+c
2010-02-15T22:53:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	use pastebin.com to show me the output if you don't know what it means :)
2010-02-15T22:55:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	no, just few seconds :)
2010-02-15T22:57:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	everything is ok ;) just use your browser
2010-02-15T22:58:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	like you got pastebin.com!!!
2010-02-15T22:59:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	yep, try and tell me :)
2010-02-15T23:06:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	once undocked your laptop can't connect wireless while it does under vista, is that what you're telling me?
2010-02-15T23:10:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	wich release of ubuntu are you running?
2010-02-15T23:11:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	i assume you're using Gnome, click on the icon of the network-manager and tell me if it lists connections once you undock your laptop
2010-02-15T23:15:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	sorry man, i can't get things clear!!! http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/wireless-t61.html
2010-02-15T23:16:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	what's your laptop brand/model?
2010-02-15T23:19:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	try this command and pastebin as usual : sudo ifconfig

2010-02-15T23:24:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	now execute : sudo route and pastebin

2010-02-16T19:11:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	try these commad lines : "sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.15.101 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.15.255 up" than "route add default gw 192168.15.1"

2010-02-16T19:12:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	sudo route add default gw 192.168.15.1
2010-02-16T19:12:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	i do not know how to sudo it, sorry i am only 3 weeks old
2010-02-16T19:12:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	i just corrected :)

2010-02-16T19:17:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	yep
2010-02-16T19:17:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	ok see you later maybe and thank you
2010-02-16T19:31:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	still as before
2010-02-16T19:32:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	you were not able to connect with the command line?
2010-02-16T19:32:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	you mean i was suppose to do that when not docked in?
2010-02-16T19:33:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	yep
2010-02-16T19:33:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	my memory is not that good
2010-02-16T19:33:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	take care ;) just try and tell me what you did and what you got
2010-02-16T19:34:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	i undocked, then i tried access to internet without success then
2010-02-16T19:35:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	i opened a terminal and scrolled through the last commands in ther and repeated the ones you gave me, without success
2010-02-16T19:35:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	now i am ready to succeed
2010-02-16T19:36:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	go ahead
2010-02-16T19:38:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	why did it not let me save the info ?
2010-02-16T19:38:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	you may not have permissions :)
2010-02-16T19:38:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	that screen is still empty, the ipv4 screen
2010-02-16T19:38:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	i am the only owner
2010-02-16T19:39:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	aha! you should fill it!
2010-02-16T19:39:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	remember i cannot save after i fill it
2010-02-16T19:39:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	running around in circle, catch 22
2010-02-16T19:40:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	should i try the other option on that screen: auto addresses only (DHCP)
2010-02-16T19:41:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	then fill in the DNS, Domain, ID
2010-02-16T19:44:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	just keep in mind : the button wont activate until you enter sufficient valid data
2010-02-16T19:45:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	ok then that probably means that there was another field that i did not filled in the third screen where number 8 is
2010-02-16T19:45:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	let me redo it all over
2010-02-16T19:45:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	if i can find your png file again lol
2010-02-16T19:46:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	it may be on any windows where the button is unclickable
2010-02-16T19:46:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	it's still at the same url : http://www.filesavr.com/wlanconfig
2010-02-16T19:47:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	i'll be back in a min :)
2010-02-16T19:47:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	imagine that, i found it before you
2010-02-16T19:47:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	lucky ;)
2010-02-16T20:23:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	well you know a heck of a lot more that i ever will
2010-02-16T20:21:00.000Z	Pianoman13	d3vic3	any suggestions as to how to solve the problem?
2010-02-16T20:22:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	i think you should have someone handy and try to configure it for you :)
2010-02-16T20:22:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	it may be something that i couldn't think about it...
2010-02-16T20:24:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	just google with different keywords till you find a solution ;)
2010-02-16T20:25:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	you may re-ask your question here as there are so many  that can help you here... enjoy
2010-02-19T04:18:00.000Z	d3vic3	Pianoman13	use your ethernet interface rather than using usb!
