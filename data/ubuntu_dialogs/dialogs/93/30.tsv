2009-05-20T00:18:00.000Z	thuglife222		but i guess koffice offers all the features like ms office offers
2009-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	jag_	thuglife222	koffice comes with KDE desktop . . Oppenoffice is better tho
2009-05-20T00:23:00.000Z	jag_	thuglife222	KDE vs Gnome - they both come with different bundled apps ex. openoffice vs office , browsers , even the way hard drives are detected works diff . .
