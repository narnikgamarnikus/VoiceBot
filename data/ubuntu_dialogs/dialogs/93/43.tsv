2008-03-02T15:48:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	you mean you can not connect to outside sites or others can not connect your servers?
2008-03-02T15:49:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	others can't connect to my server
2008-03-02T15:52:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	what kind of server is it?
2008-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	for example ftp server forwarding is not that simple
2008-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	try http server first
2008-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	or even better ssh first
2008-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I'm running ubuntu 7.10 server with a 3rd party ftp and a teamspeak server
2008-03-02T15:54:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	does ssh connections to your box from outside work?
2008-03-02T15:54:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	no
2008-03-02T15:54:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	so your box can ping your router?
2008-03-02T15:55:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	and itables rules are all ALLOW?
2008-03-02T15:56:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	even better do /etc/init.d/iptables stop to be sure
2008-03-02T16:00:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	you mean your server has an ip that should be directly accessible from internet?
2008-03-02T16:00:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	yes
2008-03-02T16:00:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	can you reach your router ip from internet?
2008-03-02T16:01:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	ping
2008-03-02T16:02:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	no I mean can you ping your router ip from outside your network
2008-03-02T16:03:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	Talking to yourself now?
2008-03-02T16:03:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	But, yes! I can't be sure whether it is the modem/router or the server responding.
2008-03-02T16:04:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I am, however, using a no-ip hostname to connect.
2008-03-02T16:05:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	sorry maybe it is a language problem :)
2008-03-02T16:05:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	but I am little confused
2008-03-02T16:06:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	could be
2008-03-02T16:06:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	your router should have WAN ip different from your server ip
2008-03-02T16:06:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	Well... it hasn't
2008-03-02T16:07:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I know it's strange, but that's the way it is
2008-03-02T16:08:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	My router is by all purposes NO WAN ip and is inaccessible from outside this LAN
2008-03-02T16:11:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I don't think the router is routing anything as long as the server is concerned other when connecting from this computer
2008-03-02T16:13:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	you can connect internet behind your NAT-ed network right?
2008-03-02T16:13:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	then it is routing
2008-03-02T16:14:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I can connect from this computer which has LAN ip, and I can download with the server from http (to get packages or something)
2008-03-02T16:16:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	to clarify once more your - the machine you are sitting right now - what ip it gives when you do ifconfig
2008-03-02T16:17:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I'm sitting on my gaming computer running vista and has ip: 10.0.0.1
2008-03-02T16:17:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	and that vista machine is connected directly to router?
2008-03-02T16:18:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	yes
2008-03-02T16:18:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	what ip you get when you access whatismyipaddress.com from vista machine
2008-03-02T16:19:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	the same ip which the server has
2008-03-02T16:22:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	and you have no proxies active?
2008-03-02T16:22:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	no
2008-03-02T16:24:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	so somehow your server and router are sharing the same ip?
2008-03-02T16:25:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	In a way yes. However, this worked beautifully when running XP with ftp and ts server
2008-03-02T16:25:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	but as I stated earlier that could be upnp
2008-03-02T16:25:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	the problem is that I do not understand how your network works ant all :)
2008-03-02T16:26:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	wait a moment :)
2008-03-02T16:26:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	mayge I got you wrong - your server machine - what it shows when you ifconfig it?
2008-03-02T16:27:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	 inet addr:88.90.227.78
2008-03-02T16:28:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	is it the same address that you get when you whatismyipaddress.com from your server machine and your local machine?
2008-03-02T16:28:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	yes
2008-03-02T16:37:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	actually I am curious now, how can it be possible that two boxes have the same WAN ip address?
2008-03-02T16:38:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	they don't? ;)
2008-03-02T16:39:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	Actually, I think you just solved my problem!
2008-03-02T16:39:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	well if you say that your server box is connected to your router and has the same ip as your router has?
2008-03-02T16:41:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	& andi6: I think it may have to do with the fact that my router is using upnp and the server using the routers WAN ip. Upon connecting from this computer to the server, could it be that the router redirects incoming connections to this computer and not the server?
2008-03-02T16:42:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	yeah but I do not understand how your server machine can access internet from
2008-03-02T16:43:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	if it has only external ip address?
2008-03-02T16:43:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	I would like to know about that technology that makes that happen, sounds interesting :)
2008-03-02T16:43:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	hehehe
2008-03-02T16:44:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	WAP?
2008-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	sorry scratch that :p
2008-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	I meant does it show WIFI interface addresses
2008-03-02T16:45:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	and yes it does
2008-03-02T16:46:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I guess so, but my server doesn't have wireless
2008-03-02T16:58:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	btw when you use your server machine browsing internet and when you use different browsers - firefox, opera and try whatismyipaddress.com then you get the same external ip always?
2008-03-02T16:59:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	maybe there is still some kind of proxy
2008-03-02T16:59:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	it's a server install... no GUI
2008-03-02T17:00:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	damn it :)
2008-03-02T17:00:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	you just told me that whatismyipaddress.com gave you from the server machine the same address as your vista machine did?
2008-03-02T17:00:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	yes
2008-03-02T17:01:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	well if your server machine does not have GUI how can you tell?
2008-03-02T17:01:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	what browser you used to access internet then from the server machine?
2008-03-02T17:02:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I'm sorry! I misread the question
2008-03-02T17:02:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I check www.whatsmyip.org from this computer and ifconfig on server
2008-03-02T17:02:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	ok I ask then once again - what ip you get when you access internet (world wide web) from your server machine directly
2008-03-02T17:03:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	I mean you go physically to your server box, use some kind of textual browser and give the result you get when you put in the address whatismyipaddress.com
2008-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I'm unsure how.
2008-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	or you can use ssh to log to your server machine and give the result using some textual browser :)
2008-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	and btw... can't I use ssh?
2008-03-02T17:04:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	now we are getting somewhere
2008-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	you mean you do not know if you can access internet from your server machine :)
2008-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I can... I've used wget
2008-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	ok
2008-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	ssh into your server machine
2008-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I've been logged on the whole time
2008-03-02T17:07:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	so what you get when you lynx from server machine :)
2008-03-02T17:07:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	but be back, your problem looks interesting
2008-03-02T17:09:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	so let me know about the lynx results :)
2008-03-02T17:09:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	How do I use lynx? lynx www.whatsmyip.org ?
2008-03-02T17:10:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	I installed lynx... runing it now
2008-03-02T17:10:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	great
2008-03-02T17:11:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	and it is the same address as your vista and router have?
2008-03-02T17:11:00.000Z	Tachdelan	realmerx	yes
2008-03-02T17:38:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	I am currently reading about bridges :)
2008-03-02T17:39:00.000Z	realmerx	Tachdelan	because I have no idea how your internet works :p
