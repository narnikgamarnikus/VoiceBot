2012-07-19T21:38:00.000Z	Asar		if it's called "Wired", then use that
2012-07-19T21:39:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	i cant configure the interface without getting into options - thats the problem
2012-07-19T21:39:00.000Z	Asar		hmm
2012-07-19T21:39:00.000Z	Asar		& you have not used 1 priori
2012-07-19T21:39:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	options button is greyed out on the interfaces - wired and wireless
2012-07-19T21:39:00.000Z	Asar		sec, go into "System Settings"
2012-07-19T21:39:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	ok
2012-07-19T21:40:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	use System Settings > Network, see if it's the same
2012-07-19T21:40:00.000Z	Asar		you should have "Options" available
2012-07-19T21:41:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	options is available but greyed out
2012-07-19T21:41:00.000Z	Asar		if not, go to the "Network Proxy" & tell what you have
2012-07-19T21:41:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	wait, you can get into the "Options" tab?
2012-07-19T21:42:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	network proxy none, no i cant get into the options tab as its greyed out
2012-07-19T21:42:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	in the terminal do "ifconfig" & set your mac address
2012-07-19T21:42:00.000Z	Asar		sheesh vesh7807, that's kinda tough... not certain what to suggest off hand
2012-07-19T21:43:00.000Z	Asar		sec, did you google your problem?
2012-07-19T21:43:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	for about a week now and i never want to move/use windows again
2012-07-19T21:44:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	did you install the "Network Manager Applet"?
2012-07-19T21:45:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	how can i be sure that its done
2012-07-19T21:45:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	am going to get that info for you, sec
2012-07-19T21:46:00.000Z	Asar		vesh, sec
2012-07-19T21:47:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	cause if i search for network connections the applet is there but i cant see the interface i use, if i try to set a static address it errors connection add failed - connection not visible or not available
2012-07-19T21:47:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	guess is you don't have the nm-applet installed
2012-07-19T21:47:00.000Z	Asar		try Synaptic vesh7807
2012-07-19T21:49:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	go to Synaptic & type in "network manager applet" & you'll see a package with an Ubuntu logo next to it
2012-07-19T21:49:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	curious if the box is green
2012-07-19T21:51:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	its installed - trying to reinstall it
2012-07-19T21:51:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	which box you talking about
2012-07-19T21:52:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	reinstalled same thing
2012-07-19T21:54:00.000Z	vesh7807	Asar	is this perhaps not a bug for gnome 3.5xxxx
2012-07-19T21:54:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	reinstall, see if your "Options" button is available
2012-07-19T21:54:00.000Z	Asar	vesh7807	yeah, there was mention of a bug on the web
2012-07-19T21:55:00.000Z	Asar		it was in the bugs.launchpad.org website
