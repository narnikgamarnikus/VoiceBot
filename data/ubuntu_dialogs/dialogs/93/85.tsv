2005-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	snorks		Does anyone know where to tweak direct rendering performance? I got an ATI card
2005-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	tweak in what way?
2005-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	performance
2005-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	what driver version do you have?
2005-10-05T09:59:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	dmesg | grep fglrx
2005-10-05T10:00:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	there'll be a line like "module loaded"
2005-10-05T10:00:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	nothing comes up
2005-10-05T10:00:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	which includes a version
2005-10-05T10:00:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	... what happens when you type fglrxinfo?
2005-10-05T10:01:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	hmm, you did.
2005-10-05T10:01:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	it prints opengl vendor string, yea i did
2005-10-05T10:01:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	okay, you must have mistyped the command I sent you
2005-10-05T10:01:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	dmesg | grep fglrx
2005-10-05T10:01:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	for all it's worth, im reinstalling ubuntu, to x86 (running amd64 now, dont like it)
2005-10-05T10:02:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	grep "fglrx.*loaded" /var/log/kern.log
2005-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	Right, good.
2005-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	you're running warty or hoary?
2005-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	hoary
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	right. if you upgrade to breezy, you'll get 8.16.20, which is a massive improvement
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ok
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	... including up to 20% better frame rate.
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	will do that once i install x86 version then
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	tho i have not done a breezy upgrade before
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	you can also download it from ATI - it'll build its own debs, but they're not trivial to get working.
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	if you're doing a fresh install, just install breezy. But only if you want to :-)
2005-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ive done the ubuntuguide.org way to get direct rendering before
2005-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	breezy is stable now?
2005-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	breezy is still pre release. It is stable in my experience (I'm running it on my work laptop)
2005-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	but if you can wait a week or two, it'll be released.
2005-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	nah ill get breezy now
2005-10-05T10:06:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	i remember when i got direct rendering to work when i used gentoo, it was a bitch. is there an easy procedure in breezy?
2005-10-05T10:07:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	for ATI, you just need to install the restricted modules, load them and change the 'radeon' in xorg.conf to 'fglrx'.
2005-10-05T10:07:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	that's it.
2005-10-05T10:07:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	you need to add 'Option "VideoOverlay" "on"' to the Device section to get xv, though.
2005-10-05T10:07:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	okay?
2005-10-05T10:08:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	hm. ill have a look on that :) still a few hours left on my backuping
2005-10-05T10:08:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	thanks though ;) perhaps I'll look for you when i come to that point
2005-10-05T10:11:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ubuntu-5.10-preview-install-i386.iso is correct?
2005-10-05T10:11:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	http://tinyurl.com/85dry

2005-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	the part for hoary
2005-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	Okay
2005-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	last url i've gotten to rebooting, then I caught you
2005-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	so haven't rebooted yet
2005-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	try the reboot, then
2005-10-06T16:10:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ok.
2005-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	how's it looking?
2005-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	I have direct rendering. But I'm not sure if it's good performance
2005-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	hmm
2005-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	what's the card?
2005-10-06T16:13:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	radeon 9800 nonpro
2005-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	anyway, glxgears doesn't print any FPS. It just starts the wheels
2005-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	Right. I have one here.
2005-10-06T16:14:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	use fgl_glxgears
2005-10-06T16:15:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	yep, that looks good.
2005-10-06T16:15:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ok great. :)
2005-10-06T16:16:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	now, two things you may find useful
2005-10-06T16:17:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	First... if you go to System -> Preferences -> Multimedia Systems Selector
2005-10-06T16:19:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ok doing
2005-10-06T16:19:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	What do I do there? Or are you writing? :P
2005-10-06T16:21:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	Can you see whether XV is working on the video sink?
2005-10-06T16:21:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	right
2005-10-06T16:22:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	you need to add to your device section the line 'Option "VideoOverlay" "on"'
2005-10-06T16:22:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	okay?
2005-10-06T16:22:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	where is this device section? xorg.conf?
2005-10-06T16:23:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	sorry, yes
2005-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	anything more in xorg.conf or do I save and quit?
2005-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	depends. Got two monitors?
2005-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	no
2005-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	then save and restart X
2005-10-06T16:26:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	well, didnt get error message
2005-10-06T16:26:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	right. That'll help if you play videos :-)
2005-10-06T16:26:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	sounds like a TV station's error signal :)
2005-10-06T16:26:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	sounds = look
2005-10-06T16:26:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	yeah
2005-10-06T16:26:00.000Z	ccooke	snorks	it's just a test pattern :-)
2005-10-06T16:27:00.000Z	snorks	ccooke	ok great. thanks man
