2009-12-25T13:08:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Have you tried sys>prefs>Display?
2009-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	soreau	raj	What are you trying to accomplish?
2009-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	soreau	raj	What graphics card do you have?
2009-12-25T13:10:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Well what is the output of: lspci|grep VGA
2009-12-25T13:14:00.000Z	soreau	raj	We need to know which graphics card you have first. Open a terminal Applications>Accessories>Terminal then type 'lspci||grep VGA' without tick marks then press enter. Paste the output here
2009-12-25T13:16:00.000Z	soreau	raj	If you put peoples nicknames in what you say, it will highlight the person so they can better assist you
2009-12-25T13:16:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Yes
2009-12-25T13:16:00.000Z	raj	soreau	 i sended u the graphic card model
2009-12-25T13:17:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Right, so you have an intel chipset/gpu
2009-12-25T13:17:00.000Z	raj	soreau	 exactly
2009-12-25T13:17:00.000Z	soreau	raj	What resolution is being reported and which one are you trying to achieve?
2009-12-25T13:18:00.000Z	raj	soreau	i am having 800 x600 and 640 x 480 i want 1024 x 768
2009-12-25T13:20:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Can you pastebin your X log? An easy way to do this is by running the following in your terminal: sudo apt-get install curl && cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us
2009-12-25T13:20:00.000Z	soreau	raj	That should install curl then print a url containing your X log which you can paste back here for us to see
2009-12-25T13:22:00.000Z	raj	soreau	how can i paste
2009-12-25T13:22:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Just run this command in your terminal: sudo apt-get install curl && cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us
2009-12-25T13:24:00.000Z	raj	soreau	how to copy and paste in terminal
2009-12-25T13:25:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Copy from terminal, highlight. Then to paste somewhere else (like here) use middle click of your mouse to paste what you just highlighted
2009-12-25T13:27:00.000Z	raj	soreau	i followed ur command
2009-12-25T13:27:00.000Z	soreau	raj	s/ur/your

2009-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	soreau	raj	You typed the wrong command
2009-12-25T13:30:00.000Z	raj	soreau	 : what is it then
2009-12-25T13:32:00.000Z	soreau	raj	When we tell you a command, you should not include your nick (raj) with it
2009-12-25T13:32:00.000Z	raj	soreau	 ok brother
2009-12-25T13:33:00.000Z	soreau	raj	That is good enough, hang on

2009-12-25T13:49:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m2a67d4b6
2009-12-25T13:50:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Bah. That was not supposed to happen. Sorry, maybe you can ask in #intel-gfx
2009-12-25T13:51:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: what is the problem
2009-12-25T13:51:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Intel sucks :P
2009-12-25T13:51:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: i cant get the resolution what i want
2009-12-25T13:52:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: who can help me
2009-12-25T13:52:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Maybe you can ask in #intel-gfx about your problem.. on radeon/ati that would have worked
2009-12-25T13:52:00.000Z	soreau	raj	I mean intel sucks for gpu's, not spu's
2009-12-25T13:52:00.000Z	soreau	raj	cpu's*
2009-12-25T13:53:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Radeon/ATI was 3D OOTB too
2009-12-25T13:53:00.000Z	soreau	raj	s/was/has
2009-12-25T13:55:00.000Z	raj	soreau	so there is no way u can help me out
2009-12-25T13:56:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Basically you need to add a 1024x768 mode through xrandr or xorg.conf so you will have that mode available. If your monitor is not capable of this, it likely will not work
2009-12-25T14:10:00.000Z	soreau	raj	I am still here
2009-12-25T14:10:00.000Z	soreau	raj	I am not sure why it would work on a live cd but not after you install it
2009-12-25T14:10:00.000Z	soreau	raj	It should work
2009-12-25T14:10:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: i think its a defect in ubuntu
2009-12-25T14:11:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: so there is no way to fix this?
2009-12-25T14:11:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: say perfectly so that i can go back to windows
2009-12-25T14:12:00.000Z	soreau	raj	I don't care which OS you use, I would like to know why ubuntu is acting in this way though
2009-12-25T14:12:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: u would better ask who invented ubuntu
2009-12-25T14:13:00.000Z	soreau	raj	heh, I don't think it is that simple. More likely, you better ask the intel driver maintainer group
2009-12-25T14:13:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: intel rocks
2009-12-25T14:14:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: as i am new to ubuntu i came here to ask
2009-12-25T14:14:00.000Z	soreau	raj	But flooding and asking the same question over again wont get you anywhere. better ask in #intel-gfx
2009-12-25T14:14:00.000Z	soreau	raj	If you want to get support in #intel-gfx, you have to be persistent and patient
2009-12-25T14:14:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: i think u people are also new nothing difference
2009-12-25T14:15:00.000Z	soreau	raj	Impatience will get you nowhere
2009-12-25T14:15:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: what is intel - gfx
2009-12-25T14:15:00.000Z	raj	soreau	: maintain clarity
2009-12-25T14:15:00.000Z	soreau	raj	It will bring you to a channel for intel graphics
