2005-11-28T10:34:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	ok you don't have to type $
2005-11-28T10:34:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	you know your currently root.. there is no need to be root.. be your normal user sean
2005-11-28T10:35:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 so get rid of $ for starting or when i installed
2005-11-28T10:35:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	either.. you don't need to put a $ in front.. that means as a normal user.. where as # is the prompt when your root
2005-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 so i should install again and then execute again
2005-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	do you see how your currently root@Sean ???  you should be root unless you are doing something very specific
2005-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	err should NOT be root (typo)
2005-11-28T10:37:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 ok how do i change that (sorry and thanks)
2005-11-28T10:37:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	np.. did you at soem point do a "sudo su"?
2005-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 dont htink so
2005-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	how did you open your terminal?
2005-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	with a shortkut i made on my desktop
2005-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	do you know what that shortcut points to?
2005-11-28T10:39:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	cant remeber
2005-11-28T10:39:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 bad typer sorry
2005-11-28T10:40:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	apps, system tools, root terminal
2005-11-28T10:40:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	it isn't a problem. it appears that the shortcut creates a terminal as root the super user.. i would suggest using the terminal in Applications-Accessories-Terminal
2005-11-28T10:40:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 and restarting the whole gat apt
2005-11-28T10:40:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	that is the super user one.. with that one if not careful. you can mess your system up. its like typing sudo in front of every command
2005-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 thanks for your help i will try that
2005-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	i'd close that window and open up a normal on from the accessories window
2005-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	then i have a couple thigns for you to try.. we will fix the permissions on the fiels .. and then hopefully get the application to start
2005-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 k ready
2005-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	"sudo chown -R root /usr/NX"
2005-11-28T10:43:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 k got sean@sean
2005-11-28T10:43:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	good.. now try the command "sudo chown -R root /usr/NX" if you haven't yet
2005-11-28T10:44:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 k did that

2005-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	when you create a new entry  the command line would be /usr/NX/bin/nxclient
2005-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	Cole	fletch33	and the name would be whatever you want to call it
2005-11-28T10:57:00.000Z	fletch33	Cole	 ok trying that thanks
