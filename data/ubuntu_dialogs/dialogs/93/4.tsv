2012-04-04T13:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	if nobody knows, nobody can reply. Can they?
2012-04-04T13:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	use your backups for your files
2012-04-04T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	if you use CTRL+ALT+F1 you can login there and may help
2012-04-04T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	try restarting your window manager
2012-04-04T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	use TAB and ENTER to press the buttons on the UI
2012-04-04T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	do you use a mouse or is it a touchpad?
2012-04-04T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	use ALT+TAB to make the window active
2012-04-04T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	which release are you using?
2012-04-04T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	got a usb mouse?
2012-04-04T14:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	does that click?
2012-04-04T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	i've heard the WM stops accepting clicks. Compiz does it more than the others
2012-04-04T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	what is the file name and where is it stored?

2012-04-04T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	ALWAYS try and find a PPA rather than that sort of thing, in Ubuntu it is rare to need to manually download apps
2012-04-04T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	search for them
2012-04-18T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	which release?
2012-04-18T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	should be saved in the user's home folder like it does in an installed OS
2012-04-18T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	~/.mozilla/firefox   same as in an installed OS
2012-04-25T09:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	k3b is the default cD burner in KDE.
2012-05-02T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	check /var/log/cups

2012-05-31T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	you can install each desktop on the same ubuntu, you will just choose the desktop at login
2012-05-31T03:30:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	so that will be full setup iso installed on top of same ubuntu or it will be just DE ?
2012-05-31T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	just the DE and the apps for the DE
2012-05-31T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	at log in you will use the cog menu next to your name in lightdm and select the desktop to use
2012-05-31T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	you could download the live CD ISOs and have grub2 boot them if you want, bit more effort
2012-05-31T03:31:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	how to do it ?
2012-05-31T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	not something I've done but I know grub2 can boot stored ISO files.
2012-06-20T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	mounty is pretty sweet
2012-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	ok
2012-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	the OS can do it already using the mount command
2012-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	how ?
2012-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	sudo mkdir /media/iso; sudo mount -o loop /path/to/file.iso /media/iso
2012-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	ok
2012-06-20T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	obviously you can mount where you wish, but you get the idea
2012-06-20T17:50:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	yea
2012-06-20T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	better than windows that needs 3rd party apps :)
2012-06-20T17:51:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	my motive was to mount the iso so system sees it as a cd or dvd n not just mount and open the iso...
2012-06-20T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	the 2 are the same in ubuntu, what is your aim?
2012-06-20T18:00:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	so any 3rd party app for mounting iso as virtual cd dvd
2012-06-20T17:53:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	i was using aptoncd....and it creates iso...but when mounting the same iso....system mounts it as a virtual iso n not cd/dvd and aptoncd does'nt recognizes it and keeps on asking to insert cd/dvd.....
2012-06-20T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	hmm, is there a tweak in config to use a folder?
2012-06-20T17:54:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	what tweak ?
2012-06-20T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	in aptoncd
2012-06-20T17:54:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	yea....
2012-06-20T17:55:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	but i have saved aptoncd deb files from apt cache and install from there
2012-06-20T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	if you go into the packages folder in the ISO there is all the deb files and you can install from there
2012-06-20T17:59:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	yea that i can but the problem is that it contains all the debs of all apps installed on system which i dont want......in aptoncd i can which apps ddebs i wanna install n i can install that app only with its dependencies which also cannot be seen in iso folder
2012-06-20T18:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	i guess, if there isn't an option to use the ISO file, or it can't be made to use a folder of the mounted ISo then I'm not sure

2012-09-27T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	you will need to download the compiler which is a tonne more data than the PPA method, the PPA is also easier to use
2012-09-27T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	and the output of:  uname -a
2012-09-27T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	firefox 15 is default in Precise. just run:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install firefox

2012-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	myhero	you don't need the ISO, you can upgrade using the web. If you edit /etc/apt/sources.list  you can add the CD as a repo, or use some other commands etc
2012-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	myhero	ActionParsnip	that will be good.....how to do it ??
