2008-05-18T20:43:00.000Z	eax		Hello :) Can anyone help me mount my external HDD? I've done exactly as it says, meaning rebooting with it in windows twice and used the safe removal thing. Any help? Forcemount doesn't work either :/ It's NTFS

2008-05-18T20:45:00.000Z	adaran	eax	does the device work?
2008-05-18T20:46:00.000Z	adaran	eax	can you read the partition table?
2008-05-18T20:46:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Yes, what's the partition table?
2008-05-18T20:46:00.000Z	adaran	eax	type in "dmesg" in the console
2008-05-18T20:46:00.000Z	adaran	eax	that should give you a hint about the device node (for example /dev/sd?)
2008-05-18T20:47:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Yes got a lot of text
2008-05-18T20:47:00.000Z	adaran	eax	the lines at the bottom
2008-05-18T20:47:00.000Z	adaran	eax	how many other hdds do you have attached
2008-05-18T20:47:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Only the internal, the lines at the bottom have something to do with keycodes: [ 2801.740000] atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e033 <keycode>' to make it known.
2008-05-18T20:48:00.000Z	adaran	eax	hmm, no, that's not what i'm looking for. the internal harddrive, is it an IDE or S-ATA drive?
2008-05-18T20:48:00.000Z	adaran	eax	or something more exotic?
2008-05-18T20:48:00.000Z	eax	adaran	But something with: Loop loaded (max 8 devices) oO
2008-05-18T20:49:00.000Z	adaran	eax	try :    cat /proc/partitions
2008-05-18T20:49:00.000Z	adaran	eax	should give you a list of partitions and hd devices
2008-05-18T20:50:00.000Z	eax	adaran	major minor  #blocks  name
2008-05-18T20:50:00.000Z	adaran	eax	stop
2008-05-18T20:50:00.000Z	eax	adaran	okay Sorry :)
2008-05-18T20:51:00.000Z	adaran	eax	well there are two harddrives, sda and sdb
2008-05-18T20:52:00.000Z	adaran	eax	most likely sdb is your external drive
2008-05-18T20:53:00.000Z	adaran	eax	the external drive is 200 GB?
2008-05-18T20:53:00.000Z	adaran	eax	internal 40 GB?
2008-05-18T20:53:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Sorry, no it's 360gb and the internal is 80
2008-05-18T20:54:00.000Z	adaran	eax	well, that fits =)
2008-05-18T20:54:00.000Z	eax	adaran	great :)
2008-05-18T20:54:00.000Z	adaran	eax	try: sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb        # do not save anything, just look at it, then quit
2008-05-18T20:54:00.000Z	adaran	eax	that should show you 1 partition, sdb1
2008-05-18T20:55:00.000Z	adaran	eax	should also give you a hint of what's on it
2008-05-18T20:55:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Yes, I see it. No hint on what's on it
2008-05-18T20:55:00.000Z	adaran	eax	no 'type' or whatever? ntfs?
2008-05-18T20:55:00.000Z	adaran	eax	linux? windows? fat?
2008-05-18T20:56:00.000Z	eax	adaran	FS type is NTFS not much else, something about the size (MB) and the part type (primary)
2008-05-18T20:57:00.000Z	adaran	eax	okay, so sdb1 is an ntfs (windows) partition. what's your problem exactly again?
2008-05-18T20:57:00.000Z	eax	adaran	It refuses to mount :/
2008-05-18T20:58:00.000Z	adaran	eax	does it spit out an error message?
2008-05-18T20:58:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Yes, I have to reboot in windows twice (which) I've already done and otherwise to forcemount neither work
2008-05-18T20:58:00.000Z	adaran	eax	can you copy/paste the error message?
2008-05-18T20:59:00.000Z	adaran	eax	and explain what you did to mount i?
2008-05-18T20:59:00.000Z	eax	adaran	No
2008-05-18T20:59:00.000Z	eax	adaran	I inserted the USB and then it popped up that it couldn't mount :/
2008-05-18T20:59:00.000Z	eax	adaran	thanks a lot for the help :) gotta go now though :(
2008-05-18T21:28:00.000Z	adaran	eax	oh, you're using feisty... it don't think feisty has ntfs-3g ?
2008-05-18T21:28:00.000Z	eax	adaran	It does :) I've downloaded it via synaptic :)
2008-05-18T21:29:00.000Z	adaran	eax	well, any reason you're not upgrading? it should be much easier to get things running with a more recent distro
2008-05-18T21:29:00.000Z	adaran	eax	but, nevertheless
2008-05-18T21:29:00.000Z	adaran	eax	mount it manually
2008-05-18T21:29:00.000Z	adaran	eax	do you know how to do that?
2008-05-18T21:29:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Actually that's what I'm trying to :) Upgrading I mean :) Just need to save my stuff first ;)
2008-05-18T21:30:00.000Z	adaran	eax	ah, chicken, egg, i get it =)
2008-05-18T21:30:00.000Z	eax	adaran	You mean rightclicking on it and clicking mount :)
2008-05-18T21:30:00.000Z	adaran	eax	no, i mean opening a konsole/gnome-terminal, creating a folder via mkdir, then sudo mount /dev/sdb1 that_folder
2008-05-18T21:30:00.000Z	adaran	eax	err, sorry
2008-05-18T21:30:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Don't know how to :/
2008-05-18T21:31:00.000Z	adaran	eax	gnome or kde?
2008-05-18T21:31:00.000Z	adaran	eax	applications > accessories > terminal
2008-05-18T21:31:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Yes? :)
2008-05-18T21:32:00.000Z	adaran	eax	should open a terminal window, and you're in your homedir
2008-05-18T21:32:00.000Z	adaran	eax	try (i'm using $ to denote something you should type in, do NOT include the $-sign):         $ mkdir winusb
2008-05-18T21:32:00.000Z	adaran	eax	that should create a folder named 'winusb' (check with: $ ls       )
2008-05-18T21:32:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Done :)
2008-05-18T21:33:00.000Z	adaran	eax	now try: $ sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 winusb
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Failed to access '/dev/sdb1': No such file or directory
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	adaran	eax	is the external hd plugged in?
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	adaran	eax	did you unplug/replug it?
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	adaran	eax	in that case, the device node may have changed to sdc or sdd
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	adaran	eax	do $ cat /proc/partitions
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	adaran	eax	that'll give you a hint =)
2008-05-18T21:34:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Yes it is, how do I see that(sdc/sdd)?
2008-05-18T21:35:00.000Z	eax	adaran	It gives a long error with sdc and failed to access the sdd :/
2008-05-18T21:36:00.000Z	adaran	eax	$ cat /proc/partitions please
2008-05-18T21:36:00.000Z	adaran	eax	make sure your external hd is sdc1
2008-05-18T21:36:00.000Z	adaran	eax	then, copy and paste the error here, if it is only one line, otherwise, use pastebin
2008-05-18T21:36:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Pastebin? How do I change that? Right now it seems like it's sdc1
2008-05-18T21:37:00.000Z	eax	adaran	http://pastebin.com/mc662d9d
2008-05-18T21:37:00.000Z	adaran	eax	that's not the same hd
2008-05-18T21:38:00.000Z	eax	adaran	I know, I changed it to see if it worked. It didn't it's the same error :/ I can change it back if you like, just tried troubleshooting :)
2008-05-18T21:38:00.000Z	adaran	eax	don't try troubleshooting without telling me. i could've gone on for about 20 minutes doing the wrong thing without realising
2008-05-18T21:39:00.000Z	eax	adaran	Sorry about that :)
2008-05-18T21:39:00.000Z	eax	adaran	It's the big one now :)
2008-05-18T21:39:00.000Z	adaran	eax	plug the old one back in, $ cat /proc/partitions     to find out the correct device node
2008-05-18T21:40:00.000Z	eax	adaran	http://pastebin.com/d657bda1e
2008-05-18T21:40:00.000Z	adaran	eax	well, it's sdc1
2008-05-18T21:40:00.000Z	adaran	eax	you should be able to deduce that by now =)
2008-05-18T21:40:00.000Z	adaran	eax	$ sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1 winusb
2008-05-18T21:40:00.000Z	adaran	eax	pastebin any errors
2008-05-18T21:41:00.000Z	adaran	eax	brb, bathroom
2008-05-18T21:42:00.000Z	eax	adaran	http://pastebin.com/d4ee8638
2008-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	adaran	eax	$ sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sdc1 winusb -o force
2008-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	adaran	eax	try that
2008-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	eax	adaran	YAY ^^ It worked :D Thanks a lot :D
2008-05-18T21:45:00.000Z	adaran	eax	np
