2008-04-04T12:00:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	you haqve a firewall of file sharing not working on the other side
2008-04-04T12:02:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	its weird, I can access the windows shares via typing in the IP manually, but not my own. any ideas
2008-04-04T12:03:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	what do you mean not your own?
2008-04-04T12:04:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	you're trying to browse Samba shares on your local Ubuntu machine?
2008-04-04T12:05:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	yes, my own samba shares.
2008-04-04T12:05:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	have you bothered setting up SMB passwords?
2008-04-04T12:06:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	yes I have
2008-04-04T12:06:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	do you have a firewall running?
2008-04-04T12:06:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	no
2008-04-04T12:07:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	also make sure that samba is actually running "pgrep -v smbd" and "pgrep -l nmbd" should both return process numbers
2008-04-04T12:08:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	yes, they return process numbers.
2008-04-04T12:09:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	the full error is here: http://pastebin.com/m82e1355
2008-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	what does "smbclient -L localhost" give you
2008-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	I'm assuming you've set an smb password for the user you're currently using
2008-04-04T12:21:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	sorry, I'm back now.
2008-04-04T12:21:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	yes, I've set it up. and smbclient -L localhost times out
2008-04-04T12:22:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I've changed my hostname. it gives this error when I change 'localhost' to my host name: Error connecting to 127.0.0.1 (Connection refused)
2008-04-04T12:22:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	sounds like a firewall thing, like the port is somehow blocked, make sure "sudo iptables-save" doesn't return anything please
2008-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	it does return something. That something is here: http://pastebin.com/m426bbedf
2008-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	ok. that looks fine (everything is set to accept)
2008-04-04T12:25:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	what do you mean you've changed your hostname?
2008-04-04T12:26:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	so its not peddy@localhost or w/e but peddy@moonshine (name of pc)
2008-04-04T12:26:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	could this problem be with my router?
2008-04-04T12:27:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	where did you change it? did you bother rebooting afterwards? as long as we're using "localhost" or 127.0.0.1 in our commands, the router has nothing to do with it
2008-04-04T12:28:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	do you think I should enter my machine's name in the WINS server settings on my router? and I changed it a very long time ago (so yes, it has rebooted)
2008-04-04T12:28:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	well, my machines IP address
2008-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I'm really glad that you're helping me, btw
2008-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	the name or address will be important when we try to connect from other machines, lets succeed in connecting locally 1st
2008-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	but lets do a little sanity check, what does "host localhost" give you
2008-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	localhost has address 208.67.219.132
2008-04-04T12:32:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	well, you have some kind of a mess there, how exactly did you change your hostname?
2008-04-04T12:33:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I edited /etc/hostname
2008-04-04T12:33:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	the aforementioned IP is that of OpenDNS. any ideas?
2008-04-04T12:34:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	paste your /etc/hosts file
2008-04-04T12:35:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	127.0.0.1 moonshine
2008-04-04T12:36:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	well, that ain't right; have you changed that file?
2008-04-04T12:36:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	not that I'm aware of; can you help me to change it back?
2008-04-04T12:36:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	does your machine have a static address or DHCP-assigned?
2008-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	the 1st line should be  127.0.0.1 localhost
2008-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I think so, its always 192.168.1.3
2008-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	but did you set it statically or does it get it from the router?
2008-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I get it from the router
2008-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	the 2nd line should be 127.0.1.1 moonshine
2008-04-04T12:39:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	after you make the change "host localhost" should give you 127.0.0.1
2008-04-04T12:40:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	do I have to restart any services?
2008-04-04T12:40:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	I don't think so
2008-04-04T12:40:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	still giving me the same. did you mean to say 127.0.1.1 instead of 127.0.0.1 like in the first line?
2008-04-04T12:41:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	its still giving the same error as before
2008-04-04T12:42:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	I said 127.0.1.1 for the 2nd line and I meant it
2008-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	ok, same error. in /etc/nsswitch.conf, is this part like it should be? hosts: files wins dns
2008-04-04T12:43:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	in the right order*
2008-04-04T12:44:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	I rather it be "files dns wins" but it doesn't really mater as long as "files" is first
2008-04-04T12:45:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	but does "host localhost"  give you 127.0.0.1? we really need to get that sorted out first because if its not thing will break
2008-04-04T12:45:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	any ideas about it not reading /etc/hosts, though?
2008-04-04T12:46:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	nope, it does not give 127.0.0.1 I think this guy has the same issue http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-592071.html
2008-04-04T12:46:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	oh w8, yeah out dns 1st... forgot, "host" is a DNS-only command
2008-04-04T12:47:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	what does "getent hosts localhost" give you, where does "ping localhost" go?
2008-04-04T12:48:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	make it "files dns wins" in /ets/nsswitch.conf
2008-04-04T12:48:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	1st one: 127.0.0.1       localhost 2nd one: PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
2008-04-04T12:49:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	ok. looks better. now check in "smbclient -L localhost" work for you
2008-04-04T12:49:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	Error connecting to 127.0.0.1 (Connection refused)
2008-04-04T12:50:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I tried restarting samba, it gives me this: start-stop-daemon: warning: failed to kill 8436: No such process
2008-04-04T12:51:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	hmm... it might have not been running after all... re-try smbclient
2008-04-04T12:51:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	ok, it gives me shares now.
2008-04-04T12:51:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	weird that the pgrep command we've run before found processes
2008-04-04T12:52:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	a list of shares. also, in places>network there is a weird file called smb-workgroup-MyFiles
2008-04-04T12:52:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	when I try to open it, it says The filename "smb-workgroup-MyFiles" indicates that this file is of type "x-directory/smb-share". The contents of the file indicate that the file is of type "desktop configuration file" etc.
2008-04-04T12:54:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	weird. was the last time you've started gnome before or after you've changed the hostname?
2008-04-04T12:54:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	no, I renamed it about half a year ago.
2008-04-04T12:55:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	what should be in /etc/resolv.conf?
2008-04-04T12:55:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	and you've been running with a broken /etc/hosts since then? I'm surprised you could even start X...
2008-04-04T12:56:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	you shouldn't mess with it because you're using DHCP
2008-04-04T12:56:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	have you read this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=592071
2008-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	It doesn't matter, the configuration discussed there is of a server running its own DNS, its unrelated to your setup
2008-04-04T12:58:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	oh, ok
2008-04-04T12:59:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	anyway Samba works for you now doesn't it?
2008-04-04T13:00:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	nope
2008-04-04T13:00:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	but you've told me you see shares when you do "smbclient -L localhost"
2008-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	only my own ones, and I still can't access them from places>network.
2008-04-04T13:02:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	what exatly are you trying to do, have your machine read shares from other machines or the other way around?\
2008-04-04T13:03:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I got places>network>windows network>workgroup and it says: sorry, couldn't display the contents of windows network:workgroup.
2008-04-04T13:03:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I'm trying to access my own shares
2008-04-04T13:04:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	whais the name of the workgroup you've setup in /etc/smb.conf ?
2008-04-04T13:05:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	'workgroup'
2008-04-04T13:06:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	also since we've changed /ets/hosts and the "localhost" mapping this may be a goot point to restart, many thing may work differently after that, and I need to go for a while...
2008-04-04T13:06:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	whoa, I can access both computers now. I think this problem is intermittent, I could access both of them before, then couldn't, now I can.
2008-04-04T13:07:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	reboot, see if it gets better, otherwise this may be some kind of a network problem (is it wireless?) ?
2008-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	I will restart, and get back to you. Thank you incredibly for all the stuff that you've done.
2008-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	wireless network, yes
2008-04-04T13:09:00.000Z	ifireball	Peddy	hmm, reception problems maybe, but see how it behaves after a clean boot 1st
2008-04-04T13:23:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	ok, all seems to be working now, but the Window computer does not appear in places>network. I can do the smbclient command to its IP, (but not its hostname). Any ideas?
2008-04-04T13:24:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	the smbclient command gives: session request to 192.168.1.2 failed (Called name not present), as well as a list of the Windows shares
2008-04-04T13:36:00.000Z	Peddy	ifireball	you there?
