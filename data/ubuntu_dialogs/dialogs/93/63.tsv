2006-12-23T12:13:00.000Z	philo23		does any one know how to mount the ubuntu partition on HDD in live cd?
2006-12-23T12:14:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	do you know the partition?
2006-12-23T12:14:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	the number, type; what about it
2006-12-23T12:14:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	open a term:
2006-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i know, but it give me this:  wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda1
2006-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	is it formatted?
2006-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	yes
2006-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i just checked it under gparted now
2006-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	its ext3
2006-12-23T12:18:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	try this:  cat /dev/hda1 | file -
2006-12-23T12:20:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	it returns: /dev/stdin: ERROR: error while writing to temp file (No space left on device)
2006-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	I can verify that my partition is in fact an ext3 partition by doing that.    I get /dev/stdin: Linux rev 1.0 ext3 filesystem data (needs journal recovery)
2006-12-23T12:21:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	does this mean my partition is corrupt?
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	not necessarily .. live cd's are weird.
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	how else can i go about this then
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	Do you have a /dev/hda1?
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	yes
2006-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	How about a /dev/stdin?
2006-12-23T12:23:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	hda1 is ubuntu, hda2 is windows and hda3 is the ram space
2006-12-23T12:23:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	not ram phyical, fake ram, like windows paging file
2006-12-23T12:24:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	dd if=/dev/hda1 | file -
2006-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	dd: opening `/dev/hda1': Permission denied
2006-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	sudo
2006-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	k
2006-12-23T12:26:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	/dev/stdin: ERROR: error while writing to temp file (No space left on device)
2006-12-23T12:27:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	hrm.
2006-12-23T12:27:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	do that with /dev/hda2
2006-12-23T12:28:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	bash: cd: /dev/stdin: Not a directory, just tried cd to /dev/stdin, seems it doesnt exist
2006-12-23T12:28:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	ls -al /dev/stdin
2006-12-23T12:29:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	/dev/stdin: ERROR: error while writing to temp file (No space left on device)

2006-12-23T12:30:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	mount | grep proc
2006-12-23T12:30:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	proc on /proc type proc (rw)
2006-12-23T12:31:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	I'm thinking it's just a livecd issue.
2006-12-23T12:32:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	then how can i back up all my stuff with out mounting the hdd
2006-12-23T12:32:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	you weren't using lvm, were you?
2006-12-23T12:32:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	lvm?
2006-12-23T12:33:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	logical volume manager
2006-12-23T12:33:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	not sure if i did, but i think i didnt
2006-12-23T12:33:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	You have a knoppix CD lying around?
2006-12-23T12:33:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	want me to look at GParted?
2006-12-23T12:34:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	nope :(
2006-12-23T12:34:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	my other pc doesnt have a cd burner ether
2006-12-23T12:34:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	and you're using the ubuntu live cd.
2006-12-23T12:34:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	yes
2006-12-23T12:35:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	I'm going to boot into the livecd ....
2006-12-23T12:45:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	Okay... I just booted into it and it worked for me.....
2006-12-23T12:45:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	weird, i've done it before, but now it wont
2006-12-23T12:46:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	what's your swap partition.
2006-12-23T12:46:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	what do you mean?
2006-12-23T12:46:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	Do you have a swap partition for ubuntu?
2006-12-23T12:46:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	/dev/hda3 is extended and /dev/hda5 sits inside it as swap
2006-12-23T12:47:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	Okay.... sudo swapon /dev/hda5
2006-12-23T12:48:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	swapon: /dev/hda5: Device or resource busy, if your trying to mount it, i think its already, if i go by GParted, it says its locked
2006-12-23T12:48:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	my swap is 2.58 gb, if that makes a difference
2006-12-23T12:48:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i can mount the windows HDD partition, but not the ubuntu one
2006-12-23T12:50:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	I'm thinking it's corrupted.... I thinking about how to prove whether or not it is.
2006-12-23T12:50:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i hope it isnt, theres alot of stuff on there i need
2006-12-23T12:50:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	and i have around 80% backed up
2006-12-23T12:51:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	There's always fsck
2006-12-23T12:51:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	fsck?
2006-12-23T12:53:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	fsck /dev/hda1
2006-12-23T12:54:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	its says "Group descriptors" but its only just started, still running, i'll give you it all in a paste bin in a sec
2006-12-23T12:55:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	did you install windows after ubuntu?
2006-12-23T12:55:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	yes, unfortunatly
2006-12-23T12:56:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i've noticed it says "/dev/hda1 was not cleanly unmounted, check forced."
2006-12-23T12:57:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	that's good.
2006-12-23T12:57:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	did it say ext3?
2006-12-23T12:57:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	it also asks if i want to "Free blocks count wrong for group #1 (0, counted=1)."
2006-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	it doesnt say atal
2006-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	then saying if i want to correct it
2006-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	before you answer yes...
2006-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	put what you have in a pastebin
2006-12-23T13:00:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	k
2006-12-23T13:01:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/843855
2006-12-23T13:02:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	Yes... it looks like it is in fact corrupted.
2006-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	so fsck is now the proper path.
2006-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	should i try rebooting now?
2006-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	No.
2006-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	what now then?
2006-12-23T13:04:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	well... at this point it looks like you may have possibly lost data.
2006-12-23T13:04:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i just tried mounting HDA1, it worked
2006-12-23T13:04:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i'll go check out the damage
2006-12-23T13:05:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	lost blocks are usually in lost+found
2006-12-23T13:05:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	it seems all my important stuff is availible, i'll back it up then install windows then ubuntu again
2006-12-23T13:05:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	would that be ok?
2006-12-23T13:06:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	yes... that would be appropriate now.
2006-12-23T13:06:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	I think if I remember correctly windows mucks with all partitions even ones that it doesn't install to.
2006-12-23T13:08:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	thanks for the help, you've let me sleep easy tonight, knowing all my stuff is safely backed up
2006-12-23T13:08:00.000Z	__rob__	philo23	np
2006-12-23T13:09:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	would there be a way to back up my deb package lists?
2006-12-23T13:10:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	thanks, i'll google it
2006-12-23T13:10:00.000Z	philo23	__rob__	i just needed the name (dpkg) :P forgot it
