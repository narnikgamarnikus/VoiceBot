2005-05-03T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	apt-get install debfoster. It kills the bloat that ails ye

2005-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	me also, I've been in a blackout for the last couple of weeks
2005-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	geneo93	nickrud	 i wiped my kubuntu install by mistake
2005-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	so just what client are you using at the moment ;)
2005-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, i think
2005-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	geneo93	nickrud	 there is nothing there anymore
2005-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	that is a most vague statement
2005-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	gimmie a little info :)
2005-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	geneo93	nickrud	 i was d/ling a new install of kubuntu in suse but i had to come over to mandrake to do some work (work)
2005-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	I can relate to that
2005-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	geneo93	nickrud	 breezy is not quite useable yet
2005-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	I caught that from the topic :)

2005-05-28T08:51:00.000Z	geneo93	nickrud	 well in that case then why not install it to opt then
2005-05-28T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	not everything plays well
2005-05-28T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	which is why I stopped trying to be a cutting edge compiler, and became a satisfied user
2005-05-28T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	geneo93	there are issues for a free os, and they are pretty much dealt with by http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats and http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto
