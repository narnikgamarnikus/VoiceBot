2007-08-13T09:31:00.000Z	ohad		hi, does anyone know how to make the  Intel Corporation Unknown device 4230 wifi card work?
2007-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 pcmcia or internal?
2007-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	internal
2007-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 what is the laptop model?
2007-08-13T09:34:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 and maker
2007-08-13T09:34:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	thinkpad x61s
2007-08-13T09:34:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	running into some issues with wifi and suspend
2007-08-13T09:37:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 that card is supported in Gutsy, i'll look for something for Feisty
2007-08-13T09:37:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	thanks. i'm running feisty with 2.6.22-9 generic
2007-08-13T09:37:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 its the iwl4965 module, i think
2007-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	yes it is
2007-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	i am trying to do this -- http://kuscsik.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-to-install-intel-4965-wireless.html
2007-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 have you looked at this? http://tinyurl.com/3dnzyc
2007-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	but not sure if it will work
2007-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 it's hard to get the right patch for the right kernel, i find
2007-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	yes it is
2007-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 if you can find the Windows driver (ack!) you can try ndiswrapper too
2007-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	i found those. the install did not work
2007-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 does network manager see the card at all
2007-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 they rarely do
2007-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 you have a card with new hardware, and it takes some time for the restricted modules to show up
2007-08-13T09:43:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 then there is Intel's driver.  doesn't need patching i think http://intellinuxwireless.org/?p=iwlwifi&n=howto-iwlwifi
2007-08-13T09:44:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	i'll try that
2007-08-13T09:44:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	thanks
2007-08-13T09:46:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	so i hope i resolved the wireless issue. now suspend :/
2007-08-13T09:46:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 try uswsusp
2007-08-13T09:46:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 works faster and flawlessly on my T60
2007-08-13T09:47:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	installed that. we'll see how that goes.
2007-08-13T09:47:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	great - what about sound -- i have to run this python script manually to get sound to work
2007-08-13T09:47:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 huh?
2007-08-13T09:48:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	sound is not working natively - i have to run this script for it to work
2007-08-13T09:49:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 in a terminal, does alsaconf find anything?
2007-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	sudo: alsaconf: command not found
2007-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 there you go!  apt-get install alsa
2007-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	already in the lastest version
2007-08-13T09:51:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 apt-get install alsa-utils
2007-08-13T09:51:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	already in the latest version
2007-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 that's right.  it isn't there in Fiesty.  i forgot sorry
2007-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	ok. np
2007-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 does /etc/init.d/alsa-utils start do anything?
2007-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	yep. started
2007-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 and open alsamixer
2007-08-13T09:53:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 alsa is muted on install sometimes.  maybe it just needs to be turned up?
2007-08-13T09:55:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	it seems like it is in full vol but nothing
2007-08-13T09:55:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	no sound
2007-08-13T09:55:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 hmmm
2007-08-13T09:55:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller
2007-08-13T09:56:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 i have the 82801G working with snd_hda_intel
2007-08-13T09:56:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 is that module loaded?
2007-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	which module?
2007-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	snd_hda_intel? modprobe snd_hda_intel ?
2007-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 snd_hda_intel
2007-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 yeah?
2007-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	just ran that. let me restart and see if the wireless and the sound works. brb
2007-08-13T09:57:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	thanks
2007-08-13T09:58:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 put it into /etc/modules to load at boot
2007-08-13T09:58:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	what else should i put in module?
2007-08-13T09:58:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 it will load dependent modules with it
2007-08-13T09:58:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 snd_xxxx stuff
2007-08-13T10:00:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	ok. brb..
2007-08-13T10:04:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	still no sound..
2007-08-13T10:04:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 rotten
2007-08-13T10:04:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 what window manager?  gnome?
2007-08-13T10:05:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 have you checked that both PCM and Master are turned up?
2007-08-13T10:08:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	so no sound and wireless is still flaky -- getting the following message on the syslog -- iwl4965: REPLY_ADD_STA failed
2007-08-13T10:09:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 when my T60 was new this is the same s**t i went through before driver support caught up
2007-08-13T10:09:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 did sound work in the LiveCD on install?
2007-08-13T10:09:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 or wireless?
2007-08-13T10:09:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	that sucx
2007-08-13T10:09:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	5: REPLY_CT_KILL_CONFIG_CMD succeeded Aug 13 00:05:09 mux NetworkManager: <WARNING>^I get_scan_results (): card took too much time scanning.  Get a better one.
2007-08-13T10:10:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 try tuxmobile of linux-on-laptops (google 'em) and search for your X61s
2007-08-13T10:10:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	never tried the sound on the live cd. i can run this python script that i found for the t series and that works. but i always have to run it
2007-08-13T10:11:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	looked already. didn't find my laptop there..
2007-08-13T10:11:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 can you put it as an init script to run at boot?
2007-08-13T10:11:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 that isn't a pretty fix but it would work
2007-08-13T10:11:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 you can pastebin the script for us
2007-08-13T10:13:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	which one?
2007-08-13T10:14:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33530/
2007-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 yeah, that's messed up
2007-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 i think you have to wait for Gutsy
2007-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 it is supported in Gutsy
2007-08-13T10:20:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	how would i use that?
2007-08-13T10:21:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 when you install Gutsy, if it is like Feisty, it will have a balloon for Restricted-Manager saying the stuff is working
2007-08-13T10:22:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	wireless worked find under gutsty but many other things didn't
2007-08-13T10:23:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 i had to wait, like you, for new drivers
2007-08-13T10:23:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 still am for the fglrx to catch up to AIGLX
2007-08-13T10:23:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 new hardware is like that since drivers are slow to appear, it seems
2007-08-13T10:23:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	ok. i guess that's what i'll have to do. maybe i'll use my pcmacia card i have -- it's old. probably will work fine:)
2007-08-13T10:24:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 just for a little while.  or you have a few other ways to try
2007-08-13T10:24:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 i'd try the source again, but do a make uninstall in the dir and a make clean, re-configure etc
2007-08-13T10:24:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 i compile my madwifi-ng stuff manually
2007-08-13T10:25:00.000Z	sin2gen2	ohad	 and most other things, really.  like the fingerprint thing, hdaps, video on my Thinkpad...
2007-08-13T10:29:00.000Z	ohad	sin2gen2	thanks for your help and thanks to everyone for helping out
