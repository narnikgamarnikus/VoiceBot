2012-05-13T13:48:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		What's the ls command for listing something containing specific text? Such as ".wav"?
2012-05-13T13:50:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	are you trying to find text inside of files?
2012-05-13T13:51:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	no, simply files containing certain texts within a directory
2012-05-13T13:51:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	via the command line:P
2012-05-13T13:51:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	will that give me a list of all files with ".wav" in them?
2012-05-13T13:52:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I'm looking for files with those labels on them, not directories:D
2012-05-13T13:53:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	if you are looking for files that end with .wav, that is how you do it.
2012-05-13T13:54:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	I told you... ls /path/*.wav
2012-05-13T13:54:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	ls: cannot access /path/*.wav: No such file or directory
2012-05-13T13:55:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	you replace /path/ with the path of the directory you want to list
2012-05-13T13:55:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	oh, haha... how embarrassing:/
2012-05-13T13:57:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I keep getting "no such file or directory":-S
2012-05-13T13:57:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	put here what you are typing in a terminal
2012-05-13T13:58:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	"sirriffsalot@aspire:~$ ls /home/sirriffsalot/Music/*.wav" for example
2012-05-13T14:03:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	find ~/Music/ -type f -name '*.wav'
2012-05-13T14:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	whoooa
2012-05-13T14:04:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	surprisingly few .wav files there, cheers mate!=)
2012-05-20T18:27:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	lspci -nn | grep VGA
2012-05-20T18:27:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	03:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation G98 [GeForce G 100] [10de:06e6] (rev a1)  and 02:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation C77 [GeForce 8200] [10de:084b] (rev a2)
2012-05-20T18:28:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I get those two lines as output..
2012-05-20T18:28:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	are you trying to use both your onboard and the card?
2012-05-20T18:28:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	No idea... not intentionally at least:S
2012-05-20T18:28:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	disable the onboard in bios
2012-05-20T18:30:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	so the (rev 2) GeForce 8200?
2012-05-20T18:31:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	I would expect that that is your onboard.  however in the bios it will likely identify as "onboard"
2012-05-20T18:31:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I'll have a look, thanks for suggesting! Brb
2012-05-20T18:31:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	is this an asus m3n78 bpard by chance?
2012-05-20T18:38:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	Hi... I went into the bios (I'm on a acer aspire machine) and I can't find any options to disable the graphics cards....... this is getting annoying lol
2012-05-20T18:39:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	let me look at something
2012-05-20T18:42:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	It's an acer aspire x3200...
2012-05-20T18:51:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	can you please tell me the output of apt-cache policy nvidia-current | grep Installed
2012-05-20T18:51:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	hmm Installed: (none)
2012-05-20T18:52:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	if I were you, I would sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates
2012-05-20T18:52:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	trying that then, finger crossed:)
2012-05-20T18:54:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	nvidia-current-updates nvidia-settings-updates these two packages were going to be installed as a result... sound right?
2012-05-20T18:55:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	praying for some luck...:D
2012-05-20T18:56:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	alright, shall I just reboot now when it's finished installing?
2012-05-20T18:57:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	haha:) cheers. rebooting then. *prays incessantly*
2012-05-20T18:59:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	Now my system details says I have "GeForce G100/PCIe/SSE2 " as a driver:D
2012-05-20T19:00:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	in what way?
2012-05-20T19:00:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	logging in to the game:P
2012-05-20T19:01:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	as a side benefit... you can likely use multiple monitors, and enable twinview in the nvidia config gui.
2012-05-20T19:01:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	don't have enough space for that
2012-05-20T19:01:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	Hang on
2012-05-20T19:02:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	FPS went from 12-18 to -25-30!!
2012-05-20T19:02:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	you're my hero
2012-05-20T19:02:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	now my ego kicks in... how do I check which nvidia driver is installed? GeForce G100/PCIe/SSE2  I suppose is the name?:p
2012-05-20T19:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	just out of wanting to learn, where do you learn all this stuff from? I'd like to be able to handle this myself in the future, haha:)
2012-05-20T19:04:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	But is there some webpage where they cover this very specifically? Ubuntupage of some kind?
2012-05-20T19:05:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	Uhm, that command says among other things "295.49-0ubuntu0.1 "
2012-05-20T19:06:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I have no experience in "digging" in codes nor desire to try, I'd smash my computer by the end of a week
2012-05-20T19:06:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	but... what does that mean? Is it "the latest"? The most stable??
2012-05-20T19:08:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	^
2012-05-20T19:09:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I think I'll leave well enough alone for now, lol:D
2012-05-20T19:09:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	thanks a million for your help!
2012-05-20T19:36:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I wonder... i've got cpufreq installed, but I can't get it to run at 2.40Ghz, it always goes back to 1.20ghz or so... Is there a graphical user interface for configuring this?
2012-05-20T19:37:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i cores
2012-05-20T19:39:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	cpu cores    : 2 cpu cores    : 2
2012-05-20T19:42:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	what was that for?:D
2012-05-20T19:43:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	I am not sure... I am having a senior moment, I don't know if that 2.4 is supposed to be cumulative of the multiple cores, or if what you are reading should be the combined speed. I am still waking up... I am grabbing cpufreq now, have never used it.
2012-05-20T19:43:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	cool! Thanks for your time!
2012-05-20T19:46:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	not to be silly... but is your scaling multiplier right in bios?
2012-05-20T19:47:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	qu√©?
2012-05-20T19:47:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	the bios I have in this computer is dated 2009 ... might be outdated, but how do I check if that is so?
2012-05-20T19:49:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	not sure there is a function of that kind in my bios at all...
2012-05-20T19:52:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	checking again then... rebooting:D
2012-05-20T19:59:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I really can't find any such function in the BIOS...
2012-05-20T20:00:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	where are you getting the 1.2 from?
2012-05-20T20:00:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	The 1.2?
2012-05-20T20:00:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	Ah, from cpufreq-info -m
2012-05-20T20:01:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	it shows two "analyzing CPU:" sections and both say "current CPU frequency is 1.20 GHz."
2012-05-20T20:03:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	you given up too?:D
2012-05-20T20:04:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	no... I am trying to figure out how to use this tool... and I am in a few other chats atm.. just be patient with me.
2012-05-20T20:05:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I do apologize, haha:)
2012-05-20T20:05:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	all I have available is cpufreqd... and that command is not recognized... and... I am very tired.
2012-05-20T20:06:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	alright, sleep well:)
2012-05-20T20:06:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	I am still working... just not waking up... I can't sleep atm...
2012-05-20T20:07:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	oh, well don't beat yourself up, I'm happy!

2012-05-21T00:28:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	bios manipulation is no joke... you are best sticking to the utils
2012-05-21T00:28:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	yeah, better leave well enough alone
2012-05-21T00:29:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	let's make it more simple then; I'm on a acer aspire x3200... Can't find how do increase the cpu speed anywhere in the bios=(
2012-05-21T00:29:00.000Z	L3top	sirriffsalot	have you looked at the manual from your manufacturer?
2012-05-21T00:30:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	no.. no idea where it is haha):
2012-05-21T00:30:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	haha, alright!
2012-05-21T00:33:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	I can't find my computer model in the website... haha:)
2012-05-21T00:33:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	L3top	Nvm, found it
