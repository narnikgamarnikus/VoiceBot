2005-05-26T14:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	shouldn't admit this, but running Ubuntu is the 1st time in 5yrs I've had a legal OS on my PC... :)
2005-05-26T14:15:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	heh, 5 years only?
2005-05-26T14:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	well, before that I didn't own my own comp, so just 5yrs, ya...
2005-05-26T14:18:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	ehe :)
2005-05-26T14:18:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	is ubuntu your first linux distro install?
2005-05-26T14:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	yes, 98 & XP before last week. total linux noob here...
2005-05-26T14:19:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	cool, welcome
2005-05-26T14:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	it's mostly fun. really like the sound/vid apps that U installs w/
2005-05-26T14:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	but I really, really miss Photoshop... :(
2005-05-26T14:28:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	whatever works for you, just relaying my experience
2005-05-26T14:22:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	gimp can do all but a few things ps can
2005-05-26T14:22:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	i had to sit down and work on a commercial project for about 2 day to unlearn ps
2005-05-26T14:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	need to get used to the GIMP, that's all. was pretty good w/ PS, need to spend a weekend w/ the GIMP..
2005-05-26T14:24:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	just keep in mind that you litterally haveto deprogram from it, you will love what it can do :)
2005-05-26T14:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	deprogramming from PS? the Cult of Adobe lives! :)
2005-05-26T14:24:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	when you combine gnome, multiple desktops, and the fact that gimp is not constrained by mdi ...
2005-05-26T14:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	know what u mean tho, i keep trying PS keybrd shortcuts in the GIMP and then swearing...
2005-05-26T14:26:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	yes that got me too
2005-05-26T14:27:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	i actually made a mistake by trying the ps shortcuts for imp (they are there you just haveto turn them on)
2005-05-26T14:27:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	i found that the problem with ps like gimp is that you only get like 50% of the way there to ps, but its still not ps
2005-05-26T14:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	does stock GIMP have PS shortcuts included somewhere?
2005-05-26T14:28:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	so it ended up feeling like a retarded step child, instead i just decided to learn gimp shortcuts
2005-05-26T14:28:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	yes, google it
2005-05-26T14:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	yeah, 'going native' is probably the best way to go.
2005-05-26T14:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	will google for the PS shortcuts. thnx for the tip.
2005-05-27T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	great point, actually.
2005-06-25T11:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	better robot story here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4077698.stm  :)
2005-06-25T11:07:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	ha!  that is much better than my robot story
2005-06-25T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	no, Canadian, actually. A friend sent me that URL, and I use the BBC website a lot anyway!
2005-07-20T13:30:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	you need one of the jumping cats pics instead i think
2005-07-20T14:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	wow, that's a lot of flash. is there a point to it?
2005-07-20T14:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	you do/did web design?
2005-08-01T14:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	exactly my problem - I keep hitting the PS keys in GIMP...
2005-08-01T14:01:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	right i have greater than 10 years of ps
2005-08-01T14:03:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	i haveto admit, that i absolutely HAVETO have the zoom and wand shortcuts like ps
2005-08-01T14:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	I thought it was odd that gimp doesn't even have the zoom mapped to a key by default...
2005-08-01T14:04:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	*nod*
2005-08-01T14:41:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	it does?
2005-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	yup. openclipart.org is suddenly a lot easier to browse!
2005-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	ubuntu packages for so many *nix branches - but the Ubuntu one came in quickly!
2005-08-01T14:46:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	i noticed that, very cool indeed
2005-08-01T14:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	beat me to the next part! ;)
2005-08-01T14:49:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	indeedy, i can view svg!
2005-08-05T05:09:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	weird, are you on the west coast?
2005-08-05T05:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	yeah. BC
2005-08-05T05:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	where in BC?
2005-08-05T05:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	yup - even worse: Burgundavia is my younger brother...
2005-08-12T13:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	already did that, it's a great app!
2005-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CategoryGames
2005-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	even
2005-08-12T13:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	np ;)
2005-09-03T11:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	what *are* you doing? 300 tabs?
2005-09-03T11:14:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	browsing a folder quickly, you open up a bunch of links in tabs and cycle through with ctrl/w ... i just wanted to see how epiphany handles a large load, ff dies at about 40 or 50
2005-09-03T11:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	what sort of extension?
2005-09-03T11:16:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	play through bookmarks, with forward, back, pause, play icons.  perhaps some sort of setting to check off which folders you want to play through
2005-09-03T11:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	interesting - I'd have to see a demo before I really grokked that idea, I think (besides, I use Opera myself...)
2005-09-06T12:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	I think you have to use a chainsaw on zombies... that's what Hollywood says, anyway! ;)
2005-09-10T07:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	thanks, bookmarked!
2005-09-13T12:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	who says?
2005-09-13T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	kasperky ... lemme get a link, it was a real bs article
2005-11-08T14:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	can't get it, can't ping either - .com and .ca
2005-12-03T16:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	running an Apache/PHP/MySQL stack is easy enough on an Ubuntu machine, if you want to watch PHP in action
2005-12-03T16:23:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	of course, i'm testing out the wysiwyg functionality of quanta
2005-12-17T12:22:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	a non answer might be to suggest using gnome baker ... not sure if kde gives you that granular control over apps
2005-12-17T12:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	gnomebaker only burns coasters for me :|
2005-12-17T12:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	it's not...
2006-01-14T10:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	but it's Gnome users who're the idiots, Torvalds said so! :P
2006-01-14T10:24:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	i'm taking away your stir stick
2006-03-24T14:38:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	perhaps its time to start thinking about a section on the wiki called its a good thing *tm* / its a bad thing *tm*
2006-03-24T14:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	the trouble is, the wiki is already full of good advice, and not enough people read it... :P
2006-03-24T14:41:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	thats a pretty darned good point ... if everyone read the wiki this channel would be fairly quiet
2006-03-24T14:41:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	perhaps we need a big icon in the default login setup that is labeledsomething like "HOW TO USE UBUNTU" an dpoitns to wiki or something
2006-03-24T14:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	the basic documentation for Dapper is going to be a lot better (doc.ubuntu.com if you want a preview)
2006-03-24T14:43:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	*ooh* you guys are working on that? nice
2006-03-24T14:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	I happen to be, I'm on the Ubuntu DocTeam as well as loitering here far too much :P
2006-03-24T14:43:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	sweet, you've always given lots of great advice to the peeps
2006-03-24T14:44:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	is that run as a wiki or?
2006-03-24T14:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	it's not a wiki, but if you've got suggestions, you could join the DocTeam mailing list
2006-03-24T14:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/Contact
2006-04-07T06:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	cool it, all right?
2006-05-04T12:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	#ubuntu-offtopic - and post the URL ;)
2006-05-11T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	cool it, OK?
2006-05-19T10:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	since when does Sony qualify as nice? "Accept the rootkit and shut up already" Sony? :P
2006-05-19T10:03:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	hehe :) i know your screwed either way
2006-05-19T10:03:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	my only hope is that the ps3 has a linux os and somehow that spurrs some development for tools on this platform
2006-05-29T12:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	holycow	language, thanks
2006-05-29T12:25:00.000Z	holycow	Madpilot	the s word got through :)
