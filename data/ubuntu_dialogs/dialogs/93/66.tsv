2006-08-27T13:12:00.000Z	foo		Any idea why when I do any configs via the CLI GUI the thing is borked? http://x01.ath.cx:81/temp/distort.png
2006-08-27T13:14:00.000Z	foo		Any idea why when I do any configs via the CLI GUI the thing is borked? http://x01.ath.cx:81/temp/distort.png - I just fixed the link
2006-08-27T13:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	cli gui?
2006-08-27T13:14:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Scratch that. Look at the link I pasted. It says what I'm talking about - thanks
2006-08-27T13:15:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	how is it borked?
2006-08-27T13:15:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	uh, look at the screen shot. See all those distorted characters?
2006-08-27T13:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	oh! what terminal are you using?
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	# echo $TERM
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	heh, that's probably the problem
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	inside of what term?
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	rxvt
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	i know that i've had problems with some apps looking nasty like that inside of screen in rxvt
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	my suggestion is screen inside of xterm
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	I was having issues with xterm
2006-08-27T13:17:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	what issues?
2006-08-27T13:18:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Well, not really issues.. I couldn't find a way to increase the font size.
2006-08-27T13:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	here's a nice font. just a second
2006-08-27T13:18:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	insert these two lines in your .Xresources
2006-08-27T13:18:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	It was just too small and hard on the eyes
2006-08-27T13:19:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	you can set the facesize to whatever you want
2006-08-27T13:19:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	thanks
2006-08-27T13:19:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	I don't have that file on my system, where do I put it
2006-08-27T13:19:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	put those into /home/foo/.Xresources
2006-08-27T13:20:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	thanks
2006-08-27T13:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	and then do xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
2006-08-27T13:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	you might also want to insert this one so you can use alt
2006-08-27T13:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
2006-08-27T13:20:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	thanks, you're awesome.
2006-08-27T13:21:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	and this one will give it a nice title:  XTerm*title:           Ubuntu Terminal
2006-08-27T13:21:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	*blush* thanks
2006-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	why do you ask?
2006-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Because I want to install it :)
2006-08-27T13:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	do "which mail"
2006-08-27T13:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	did you see anything?
2006-08-27T13:30:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	hm, that returns nothing ... it only works if I have it installed :P
2006-08-27T13:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	lol. try installing mailutils
2006-08-27T13:30:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	sudo aptitude install mailutils
2006-08-27T13:31:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	hm, I use apt-get. Is there a difference.
2006-08-27T13:31:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	well, there is.. but, why aptitude? Hm
2006-08-27T13:32:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	aptitude is better with dependencies. if a program wants 20 other packages to be installed, but later you uninstall that package, aptitude will know to uninstall any of its dependencies that are no longer used
2006-08-27T13:32:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	whereas apt-get will not
2006-08-27T13:32:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	plus, it has a neater name
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	and mail is in mailutils
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	*sweet* I've had this issue before. Does it work the same as apt-get basically? (aptitude remove, install, --purge.. )
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	yup!
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	woohoo! Thanks for making it convenient guys!
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	and if you just do *sudo aptitude* it will give you a nice console gui
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	np!
2006-08-27T13:33:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Nice
2006-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	hm, maybe I should make a symlink from apt-get to aptitude, it's habit. hehe.
2006-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	i don't think that's a good idea...sorry
2006-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	now, maybe if first you did this:
2006-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	it's ok. hm, ok. I guess other programs can call on apt-get or something
2006-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	actually, nm, i just wouldn't mess with changing apt-get...
2006-08-28T10:27:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	it's dangeous to turn that off...
2006-08-28T10:27:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Haha, you're still around? I use sudo so much. Hmm. It should still work, though ..
2006-08-28T10:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	i'm sick, and i've been off and on all day b/c i've nothing better to do right now
2006-08-28T10:29:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	ah
2006-08-28T10:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	why do you need to not have a password?
2006-08-28T10:47:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	I'm setting something up and using sudo a lot.
2006-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	sudo passwd root
2006-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	su root
2006-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	? I know, but that's not what I asked :/
2006-08-28T10:48:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	i'm just saying you won't have to worry about this problem
2006-08-28T10:49:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Right, but it works on every other distro.
2006-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2006-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	(you may need to enable universe repositories)
2006-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Hehe, yeah. Ok. I didn't know if ubuntu had some trick or something
2006-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	:-). you just need to install it and then start if from the gdm
2006-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	ah, thanks.
2006-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	np
2006-09-03T06:56:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Was it you who told me to put XTerm*fontSize:             20 in .Xdefaults if I want to change the font size in my xterm?
2006-09-03T06:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	hmmm, Xterm*fontSize         somenumber, yes
2006-09-03T06:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	wait
2006-09-03T06:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	it's actually Xterm*faceSize
2006-09-03T06:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	*and without the capital X
2006-09-03T06:59:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	hmm. Not working
2006-09-03T06:59:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	I'll try that, thanks
2006-09-03T06:59:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	hmmmm....well, good luck
2006-09-03T07:00:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	hm, no luck. Any other ideas?
2006-09-03T07:01:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	well, what's your font line in .Xresources? also, are you doing xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources?
2006-09-03T07:01:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	xTerm*faceSize:             20 .. and I'm just restarting x. hmm
2006-09-03T07:01:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	oh. well, the xrdb thing is easier, haha. and what's the faceName line?
2006-09-03T07:02:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	That's all I have. hmm, what do you mean? I just want to up the font. hmm
2006-09-03T07:02:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	hmm. 20 may be too big
2006-09-03T07:02:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Hmm. ok, I'll try 12. It was just for testing purposes.
2006-09-03T07:03:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	Do I need to do that xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources ? Or what?
2006-09-03T07:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	couldn't hurt...
2006-09-03T07:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	i also have this line:  xterm*faceName:        MiscFixed
2006-09-03T07:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	to give me a gnome-terminal-like font
2006-09-03T07:04:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	It's in .Xdefaults.. do I need to put this in .Xresources?
2006-09-03T07:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	foo	ehhhh...i don't know. probably not then. i'm sorry, but i have to go.
2006-09-03T07:04:00.000Z	foo	ladydoor	hm, thanks.
