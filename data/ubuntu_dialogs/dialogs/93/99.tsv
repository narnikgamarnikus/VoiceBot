2005-04-08T16:57:00.000Z	corza		hey guys.. i'm having trouble with my network.. on my windows machine its asking me for a password and i didnt set one
2005-04-08T16:58:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Samba share huh?
2005-04-08T16:58:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	yes
2005-04-08T16:59:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	any idea??
2005-04-08T16:59:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	One way is to just set: security = share :in the global sextion of /etc/samba/smb.conf
2005-04-08T05:00:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Don't forget to restart samba afterwards /etc/init.d/samba restart
2005-04-08T05:02:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	umm in the conf file i went ; security = share.. it still came up afterwards..
2005-04-08T05:03:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	www.pastebin.com and paste in the section for the share you're offering
2005-04-08T05:03:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	And then paste the url here
2005-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	is that wat u meant :S
2005-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	"the section for the share you're offering"
2005-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	meaning.....
2005-04-08T05:05:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	the folder?
2005-04-08T05:06:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Just to clarify, it asks for the password when you try to get a list of the shares availible, or when you try to enter a share?
2005-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	um well heres what i do.. i type into my windows computer "\\ubuntu\music" (my shared folder) it then pops up and asks for a username and password
2005-04-08T05:07:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Do you mind if your samba security (as in passwords) is more or less ignored?
2005-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	i would rather it be ignored?
2005-04-08T05:08:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	i dont really want passwords at all
2005-04-08T05:09:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	http://www.pastebin.com/263686
2005-04-08T05:10:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	http://www.pastebin.com/263688
2005-04-08T05:11:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	should i add the [storage]  to mine? and edit it to my desires?
2005-04-08T05:11:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Well, storage is just the name of the share
2005-04-08T05:13:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	ok in the first pastebin url u had them all in that order.. is that 'exactly' what i need because i have all that stuff edited but.. they have jibble jabbles in between
2005-04-08T05:13:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	I don't think it matters all that much, I pulled them in from all over the place
2005-04-08T05:13:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	ill restart it and give it a go
2005-04-08T05:16:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	it's still asking for a username & password
2005-04-08T05:16:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Paste your full smb.conf to pastebin
2005-04-08T05:17:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	no prob
2005-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	You forgot to remove the ; in front of security = share
2005-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	oh i didnt know i had to do that 8-) lol
2005-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	ok i'll give that a go
2005-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Probably remove the ; in front of guest account = nobody too
2005-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	ok
2005-04-08T05:21:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	u rock dude :)
2005-04-08T05:21:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Of course *g*
2005-04-08T05:21:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	lol
2005-04-08T05:25:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	you wouldnt be able to post me your Mouse Configuration from the Default xorg.conf file would ya.. its just that i tried to configure mine so that my back and forward buttons were working.. it turned out that all of them work but they are all switched around and well i use my scroller a lot more.. lol
2005-04-08T05:26:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	What mouse do you have?
2005-04-08T05:26:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	Intellimouse Explorer 3.0
2005-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	you wouldnt know how to um fix it would ya?
2005-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Doh, that's not the default mouse section, but it's mine and it works:P
2005-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	i've been to like a million sites to fix it to no avail lol
2005-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	no prob lol it might get my scroller working properly again.
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Remember you have to reload X after chaning the config file
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	its just when i tried fixing it and putting other things in my scroller buttons switched with my back and forward buttons
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	so they were acting as each other.. and well i use my scroller more so than my back and forward buttons
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Paste your mouse section somewhere and I'll see what I can think up
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	lol i just deleted it all just wait i'll find the site where i got it from
2005-04-08T05:30:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Heh, if you use the section I pasted it might work
2005-04-08T05:30:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	ok lol
2005-04-08T05:33:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	It'll be the ZAxisMapping bit, now personally I havn't dealt with the mouse bit myself, but if you change it to "4 5" it might work like an ordinary mouse *shrug* :)
2005-04-08T05:34:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	umm yeah but it doesnt lol it then just cancels out my back and forward buttons and my scroller still acts as my back and forward buttons
2005-04-08T05:46:00.000Z	Pizbit	corza	Add them into gnome session
2005-04-08T05:47:00.000Z	corza	Pizbit	oh yeah thanks :)
