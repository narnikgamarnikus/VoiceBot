2012-03-30T09:39:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Can you get into a shell?
2012-03-30T09:40:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I am in the alt+ctrl+F1 terminal, if that is what you mean? I am accessing IRC through irssi
2012-03-30T09:40:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	alt+f1 rather... I forget I don't need to hold ctrl ;)
2012-03-30T09:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Gotcha yeah thats what I meant. Did you try --> sudo dpkg-reconfigure displaymanagername
2012-03-30T09:41:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I tried that already... it fails. Hold on - I will get the error message
2012-03-30T09:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Really? I have to hold ctrl. How did you do that? Or is that a default Ubuntu thing?
2012-03-30T09:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Install gdm and switch to that and see if that works
2012-03-30T09:42:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	sudo apt-get install gdm && sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2012-03-30T09:45:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	hold on... before I try to revert to GDM, what do you think of this error for lightDM? "dpkg-mainscript-helper: warning environment variable DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME missing" and same error again but ending in "DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE missing"
2012-03-30T09:46:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	sorry if I am taking long time to anwser, but I have no idea how to copy/paste in a tty terminal so I have to type everything by hand
2012-03-30T09:54:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	are you still around?
2012-03-30T10:02:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	hey
2012-03-30T10:02:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I am back
2012-03-30T10:03:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	I see that. So did gdm work any better?
2012-03-30T10:03:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I tired booting in recovery mode to see what happened.
2012-03-30T10:04:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	And what happened?
2012-03-30T10:06:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I came to the recovery menu, wasn't sure which option to pick, so I just picked the top option (which was like start normally).. and that threw me into a command prompt. I rebooted again and the "*Starting LightDM Desktop Manager" has changed from [fail] to [ok].
2012-03-30T10:07:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Oh cool. So its working now? Can you get into X?
2012-03-30T10:07:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	but now the boot-up sequence hangs at "Starting userspace bootsplash [ok]"
2012-03-30T10:07:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	no
2012-03-30T10:07:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Okay. Try gdm and see if that works.
2012-03-30T10:16:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I jsut had visitors at the door, but now they are gone. Do you want me to try GDM now?
2012-03-30T10:16:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	May be a fix. It's up to you
2012-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	so..... sudo apt-get install gdm and then what was the rest?
2012-03-30T10:18:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2012-03-30T10:20:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	ok.. it looks like dpkg is runing automatically after entering apt-get install anyway
2012-03-30T10:20:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Well pay close attention. If it does not switch it that is the command
2012-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	it came up with a congfiguration screen asking me to choose between gdm and lightdm, and entered ok.
2012-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	?? Did you pick gdm?
2012-03-30T10:23:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	yes, forgot to mention that.
2012-03-30T10:23:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	haha. Okay. Reboot
2012-03-30T10:23:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	will reboot now to see what is broken now.
2012-03-30T10:24:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Will be here waiting for you
2012-03-30T10:27:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	hangs at a different point now. Also, it appears from the boot up messages that GDM and LightDM are trying to run simultaneously... perhaps I should purge lightdm?
2012-03-30T10:28:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Yeah try that and then reconfigure again.
2012-03-30T10:28:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I also noticed that the screen flickers a few times before it hangs, like it is trying to switch screen modes but fails.
2012-03-30T10:29:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Hmm. Maybe try killing gdm / lightdm from the console and then just booting straight into X would work or at least give you an error taht makes sense
2012-03-30T10:32:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I have just purged lightdm (which also took ubuntu-desktop with it). Now I am rebooting again. brb
2012-03-30T10:38:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	failed again. Hangs at message "* Checking battery state..."
2012-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	nope... gives me FATAL: modul nvidia_173_updates not found
2012-03-30T10:39:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Why did you remove ubuntu-desktop? I tried to stop you but you were already gone. Why all the trouble? You have some data backed up on /home right? Is that it?
2012-03-30T10:40:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	yep, it would not let me remove lightdm without ubuntu-desktop as well
2012-03-30T10:40:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Yeah ubuntu-desktop in your de I think. Your whole gui
2012-03-30T10:40:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	It is something you need
2012-03-30T10:41:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	the data is all still in my home directory. Ok, I will re-install ubuntu-desktop... but will that re-install lightdm too?
2012-03-30T10:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	It might but it shouldn't run if you reconfigure to use gdm
2012-03-30T10:42:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	If it does just kill lightdm and gdm from your console and try to boot directly into X without a display manager
2012-03-30T10:43:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	it wants to reinstall lightdm again. Will try dpkg-reconfigure on it again when it is done.
2012-03-30T10:43:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Let it and then kill your dm from the console
2012-03-30T10:43:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Both of them
2012-03-30T10:49:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	how do I kill gdm and lightdm from terminal and boot directly into x?
2012-03-30T10:50:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Use -->  sudo pkill gdm lightdm etc..
2012-03-30T10:52:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	ok, gdm and lightdm are killed. What now? Fresh re-install? ;)
2012-03-30T10:52:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Not type --> startx
2012-03-30T10:53:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	now*
2012-03-30T10:54:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	oh oh oh! I think my problem might be related to nvidia driver issue... tried startx... got a bunch of nvidia fatal errors.. no screens found, failed to load nvidia kernel module, ddxsiggiveup etc...
2012-03-30T10:55:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Cool. I knew we would get a real error that way. Do you have an nvidia card
2012-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I _was_ mucking about with "pre-release" nvidia driver in the additional hardware thingy before I attempted updates... might still be trying to use that? How do I remove and get the proper nvidia 173 driver back?
2012-03-30T10:57:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	it is an nvidia card, but I can't recall off the top of my head it's name.
2012-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	There really aren't that many different drivers
2012-03-30T10:58:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	So you install the proprietary one?
2012-03-30T11:00:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Do you have a command "nvidia-xconfig"?
2012-03-30T11:00:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	there were four listed in the hardware drivers window... nvidia version 96 (I think), version 173 and those same two versions again but "pre-release" in the name.
2012-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Do you have a command "nvidia-xconfig"? Try logging in as super user "sudo -s" and then running "nvidia-xconfig"
2012-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	yes, nvidia-settings is present.
2012-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	oops.. wrong command ;)
2012-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	brb.
2012-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	yes, the other one is there too
2012-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	sudo -s and then do nvidia-xconfig
2012-03-30T11:05:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	back
2012-03-30T11:05:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	it tells me VALIDATION ERROR: data incomplete in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and Device section "Default Device" must have driver name
2012-03-30T11:05:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	after trying to start X?
2012-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Or while running that command?
2012-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	no, after trying to do sudo -s  nvidia-xconfig
2012-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	You did one first and then the other right?
2012-03-30T11:08:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	I seem to recall there is some command that will tell you which nvidia drivers are available for your card?
2012-03-30T11:08:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	yes and no. both together first, then separate
2012-03-30T11:08:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	"apt-cache search nvidia | grep -i installed"
2012-03-30T11:09:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	the validation complaint went away.
2012-03-30T11:09:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	okay. cat out the file to make sure it worked.
2012-03-30T11:09:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	"cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2012-03-30T11:10:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	yep it lists contents of the file
2012-03-30T11:11:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	"modprobe nvidia"
2012-03-30T11:12:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	as root / sudo
2012-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
2012-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	what is that repo?
2012-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	For an nvidia driver. I do not think the one you have is working correctly.
2012-03-30T11:18:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	You could instead do "apt-cache search nvidia | grep -i installed"
2012-03-30T11:19:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	tried apt-cache thing, and it piped out no results at all
2012-03-30T11:20:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Are you catching all this ^^^
2012-03-30T11:21:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	almost... still wish I had copy & paste to make things easier ;)
2012-03-30T11:21:00.000Z	bobo37773	dalek_	Ah. Because you have to switch back and forth ttys? Hahaha. Part of your initiation :p
2012-03-30T11:31:00.000Z	dalek_	bobo37773	almoxarife - I am tempted to just do a re-install of 11.10 from a live session, and then I just won't attempt touching the nvidia driver...
