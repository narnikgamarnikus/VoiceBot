2006-09-15T12:11:00.000Z	jaypim		can I use gnome on a LAMP Installation Setup ( Server Edition )
2006-09-15T12:11:00.000Z	jaypim		?
2006-09-15T12:11:00.000Z	jaypim		startx doesnt work
2006-09-15T12:11:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	what is a `lamp installation setup'?
2006-09-15T12:12:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	: 2nd option from 6.06 Server edition
2006-09-15T12:12:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	apt-get install gnome, invoke-rc.d gdm start
2006-09-15T12:12:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	so X doesnt come default with the LAMP Installation ?
2006-09-15T12:13:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	X is not used in any of the server installations, afaik.
2006-09-15T12:13:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	ah the server edition doesn't have X ?
2006-09-15T12:13:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	it does not install it by default.
2006-09-15T12:13:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	thanks
2006-09-15T12:14:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	the only difference between `server' and `desktop' versions is what packages are installed by default.
2006-09-15T12:14:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	ah... thanks
2006-09-15T12:16:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	it says it could not find package gnome
2006-09-15T12:16:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	er, one moment.
2006-09-15T12:17:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I have a fresh installation of 6.06 server edition (LAMP Installation)
2006-09-15T12:17:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	on Ubuntu, you could install `ubuntu-desktop'.  That pulls in all the desktop packages.
2006-09-15T12:17:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	how do I do that ?
2006-09-15T12:18:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-09-15T12:18:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	ubuntu-desktop is just another package.
2006-09-15T12:19:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	weee 1.5GB of files ?
2006-09-15T12:19:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	yeah, that's why I wanted to just install gnome.
2006-09-15T12:19:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	ah, apt-get install gnome-user-environment
2006-09-15T12:19:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	waaah
2006-09-15T12:20:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	wait I'll cancel the ubuntu-desktop :)
2006-09-15T12:20:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	if you know specifically what packages you want, you could specify them individually instead of using a catch-all package like gnome-user-environment.
2006-09-15T12:21:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	Still couldn't find gnome-user-environment
2006-09-15T12:21:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	what release?
2006-09-15T12:21:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	?
2006-09-15T12:21:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I'm using 6.06 LTS Server edition
2006-09-15T12:21:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	what does /etc/issue contain?
2006-09-15T12:22:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	ah, OK.
2006-09-15T12:22:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS \n \l
2006-09-15T12:22:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	sorry, it's gnome-desktop-environment.  Transcription error.
2006-09-15T12:23:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	where did you get that ?
2006-09-15T12:23:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	aptitude search ~n^gnome
2006-09-15T12:25:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	still couldnt find gnome-desktop-environment
2006-09-15T12:26:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	hmm.  is dapper universe in your sources.list?
2006-09-15T12:26:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	/etc/apt/sources.list
2006-09-15T12:28:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I'll uncomment the two lines to add software from the universe ?
2006-09-15T12:28:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	you want a line along the lines of `deb http://... dapper ... universe'
2006-09-15T12:29:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	yup.. it says here that I have to uncomment these two lines...
2006-09-15T12:29:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	then gnome-desktop ?
2006-09-15T12:29:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	you need to run apt-get update first.
2006-09-15T12:30:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	ok
2006-09-15T12:31:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	how do I quit and save in vim ?
2006-09-15T12:32:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	:wq
2006-09-15T12:32:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	then install nano or emacs.
2006-09-15T12:32:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I'm updating apt-get now
2006-09-15T12:32:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	how do i install emacs ?
2006-09-15T12:33:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	guess.
2006-09-15T12:33:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	apt-get install emacs
2006-09-15T12:33:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	:)
2006-09-15T12:35:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	sudo y
2006-09-15T12:35:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	ooops
2006-09-15T12:36:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	gnome-desktop-environment worked :) thanks
2006-09-15T12:37:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	why are there lots of GET from http://ph.archive.ububtu...... ?
2006-09-15T12:37:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	hmm?
2006-09-15T12:38:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	does it verifies newer version of gnome files ?
2006-09-15T12:42:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	how do i install gnome from the CD ?
2006-09-15T12:43:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	erm, use apt-cdrom, IIRC.
2006-09-15T12:43:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	doesnt work
2006-09-15T12:44:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	what was the command again for intalling the 1.5GB gnome ?
2006-09-15T12:44:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	sooner or later I'm gonna leave, and you're gonna need to work things out for yourself.  Try `man apt-cdrom'.
2006-09-15T12:44:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	:)
2006-09-15T12:52:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	gnome is not on the server CD.
2006-09-15T12:52:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	that's why the server CD is much smaller than the desktop one.
2006-09-15T12:52:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	ah I see...
2006-09-15T12:53:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I see a 200MB difference
2006-09-15T12:54:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	200MB compressed.
2006-09-15T12:54:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	now I understand.. I should have gotten the desktop edition :(
2006-09-15T12:54:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	server edition is for the pro :)
2006-09-15T12:54:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	no, Debian is :P
2006-09-15T12:54:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I like to use X and it doesnt have it :)
2006-09-15T12:56:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	should I get the desktop edition or should I just apt-get ?
2006-09-15T12:57:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	I'm on broadband ... though my roommate is complaining because I'm eating all the bandwidth while downloading gnome :(
2006-09-15T12:57:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	you can probably throttle it.  man apt.conf
2006-09-15T12:58:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	throttle ?
2006-09-15T12:58:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	tell it not to use all the bandwidth.
2006-09-15T12:58:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	like a bandwidth shaper ?
2006-09-15T12:58:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	how do i do that ?
2006-09-15T12:59:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	shaping is different again.  A shaped connection assigns different priorities to different types of traffic.
2006-09-15T12:59:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	a throttle simply says "don't use more than X kB/s.
2006-09-15T12:59:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	how do I configure throttling?
2006-09-15T13:00:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	I don't know, man apt.conf, JFGI.
2006-09-15T13:00:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	:)
2006-09-15T13:00:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	what does JFGI mean ?
2006-09-15T13:00:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	lol
2006-09-15T13:03:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	try those urls.
2006-09-15T13:03:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	is there an official ubuntu book ?
2006-09-15T13:03:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	dunno
2006-09-15T13:03:00.000Z	jaypim	twb	:)
2006-09-15T13:04:00.000Z	twb	jaypim	a typographical error.
