2006-05-21T11:37:00.000Z	dooglus		is there a PLF repository available for dapper?  or is it safe to use the breezy one?
2006-05-21T11:38:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	you'd have to ask the PLF people.
2006-05-21T11:39:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	hmmm, ok
2006-05-21T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	and, that's ok if she backs out, as they're supported for years afterwards.
2006-06-01T13:46:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	no numbers are infinite
2006-06-01T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	how many integers are there then?
2006-06-01T13:47:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	all the integers are finite
2006-06-01T15:34:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	wouldn't #ubuntu+1 be eft?
2006-06-01T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	that's correct.  use gksudo.
2006-06-01T16:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	do you have any example of how sudo can mess anything up?  like a repeatable case?
2006-06-13T11:41:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	same difference.
2006-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	no, sudo can screw things up
2006-06-13T11:42:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	when running gedit?
2006-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	running everything as root? what?
2006-06-13T11:44:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	Dirge doesn't like 'permissions'.  he wants to be able to write to any file he wants.
2006-06-13T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	do you want to change the owner? or the permissions?
2006-06-13T11:49:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	neither.
2006-06-13T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	not you.
2006-06-13T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	it can.
2006-06-13T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	that's because it's not safe.  It's not an opinion, it's fact.
2006-06-13T12:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	is http://wiki.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=ntfsmount lying then?
2006-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	see, in particular, http://wiki.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=ntfs-en#how_safe_is_the_ntfs_driver
2006-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	if you have any evidence at all that it's not safe, could you point me at it please?
2006-06-18T15:11:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	one could argue that "the su password" means "the super user password" which, it is.
2006-06-21T08:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	debfoster is probably easier to use than deborphan
2006-06-21T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
2006-06-23T11:41:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	allnickstaken, gksudo
2006-06-23T11:41:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I prefer sudo.
2006-06-23T11:41:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	sudo for graphical apps breaks them.
2006-06-23T11:41:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	not gedit it doesn't
2006-06-23T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	right, but don't confuse newbies with which ones do or dont.  It's fine if you want to tempt fate, provide assistance with best practices though, please.
2006-07-28T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	it means he's run things with sudo, instead of gksudo or kdesu
2006-07-28T15:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I don't think that would ever make the command I asked him to run fail
2006-07-28T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	if he didn't have permission to read it, because it was owned by root, then yes, it would
2006-07-28T15:15:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	no, that's the exact opposite.
2006-09-22T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	he's ditching suse, just migrating his big partition over
2007-02-13T14:07:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	lynx can, if you install ssl libraries
2007-02-13T14:08:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	yes.  i believe edgy has... elinks.  let me double check.  (it's changed a few times)
2007-02-13T14:09:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	running 'www-browser' will always work though
2007-02-13T14:10:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	and, in theory/hopefully, those will fix X ;)
2007-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	the source is available, don't be silly
2007-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	really?
2007-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	of course.
2007-02-13T14:15:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I'd love to see it.
2007-02-13T14:16:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	apt-get source [package]  gets the source of that package
2007-02-13T14:16:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	right.
2007-02-13T14:49:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	no it's not.  Why do you think we have updates?
2007-02-13T14:49:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I think updates are mostly for security patches aren't they?  not for functionality.
2007-02-13T14:52:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	bugfixes and security
2007-02-13T14:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	most bugs I report get no activity on them for 6 months or so, followed up with a question "is this still an issue" and then "rejected"
2007-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	6.06.1 is 6.06.  The only differece is the CD contents.
2007-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	so its identical apart from the differences?
2007-04-05T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	when you install 6.06.1 you're installing 6.06
2007-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	6.06.1 has updated packages (newer versions), and an updated installer (because the old ubiquity had some issues)
2007-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	ubuntu is the same as the beastie boys, apart from the CD contents too
2007-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	so, literally once you've installed it.  It's identical.
2007-04-28T13:57:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	beagle probably (hopefully) calls sensible-editor
2007-04-28T13:57:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I think it calls gedit, but I'm not sure
2007-04-28T13:58:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	If it calls gedit, that's an oversight.  Did you change your default editor?
2007-04-28T13:58:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I didn't.  How would I do that?
2007-04-28T13:58:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	uh, I think there's some "preferred applications" menu item.
2007-04-28T13:59:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	there is.  it allows me to change browser, email program and terminal emulator
2007-04-28T13:59:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	alright.  `sudo update-alternatives --config sensible-editor`  Or, I believe sensible-editor is the correct u-a thing
2007-04-28T14:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	"No alternatives for sensible-editor."
2007-04-28T14:00:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	Do you have any other editors installed?
2007-04-28T14:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	oh yes
2007-04-28T14:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I built Emacs from CVS
2007-04-28T14:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	it's /usr/local/bin/emacs here
2007-04-28T14:01:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	ah.  Except, that's from CVS.  your system has no idea that exists.
2007-04-28T14:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I added it to the main menu, so it has some idea it exists
2007-04-28T14:02:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	no, that's just a menu item.  Package management (and all that goodness) has no idea it exists.
2007-04-28T14:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I used checkinstall to install it, so the package manager knows about it.  I called the package 'emacs'
2007-04-28T14:06:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	your package didn't tell the system that it was an editor.  Uh, let me... dig out the syntax.
2007-04-28T14:07:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	you'll be using update-alternatives --install, to register your emacs as an editor
2007-04-28T14:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I've set the VISUAL environment variable so that sensible-editor runs Emacs.  beagle-search still runs gedit though - ie. it's not using sensible-editor at all
2007-04-28T14:09:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	then file a bug against beagle, since it should honor sensible-editor.  And then... well, see if theres beagle config somewhere ;)
2007-04-28T14:10:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	don't tell anyone (it's a little embarrasing) but I also have 'vim' installed.  I don't even see a way to get beagle to use vim
2007-04-28T14:11:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	emacs and vim, eh?  dangerous.
2008-09-20T00:32:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	bad apostrophe placement?
2011-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	You could, but the supported method is through update-manager.
2011-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	update-manage tells me there's a problem
2011-05-31T11:07:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I pasted it a little way up here
2011-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	^-- that
2011-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	Are you completely up to date on 10.10?
2011-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	but dist-upgrade is downloading the packages
2011-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I am
2011-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I only just upgraded to it
2011-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I'm wondering if the upgrade process stopped working with apt-cacher for 11.04
2011-05-31T11:09:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I use apt-cacher so I only have to download each package file once
2011-05-31T11:09:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	I don't think it would.
2011-05-31T11:09:00.000Z	Flannel	dooglus	The mechanism is the same, so I don't see how it'd be substantially different
2011-05-31T11:10:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	it failed almost immediately - trying to authenticate the .gpg file I guess?
2011-05-31T11:10:00.000Z	dooglus	Flannel	I guess it's plausible the natty.gpg in my apt-cacher cache is corrupted
