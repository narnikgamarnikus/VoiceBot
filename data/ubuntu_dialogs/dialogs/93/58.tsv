2007-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908		uh
2007-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908		how do i get wine
2007-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	in the ubuntu repositories
2007-03-24T08:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	where can i get it
2007-03-24T08:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	the main repository, archive.ubuntu.com
2007-07-29T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	yes unless you want to execute the command yourself periodically
2007-08-04T13:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	775
2007-08-04T13:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	just think 111 111 101
2007-08-25T10:39:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	there are a few, vim the most popular
2007-08-27T08:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	that question is a bit confusing
2007-08-27T08:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	it needs xorg
2007-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	i installed the CLI system from the alt install, ran updates, and did "apt-get install xfce4". do i need to install anything like gdm (i'm actually fine with a text login)
2007-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	probably depends on your definition of need
2007-08-27T08:54:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	"need" in this case means the system won't work right (xfce4 desktop/gui will not work)
2007-08-27T08:55:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	I imagine that xfce is just a meta package to begin with, I don't think you will need anything else but that is really hard to know because you could have an incompetent packager
2007-08-27T08:55:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	don't install it with aptitude
2007-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	i used apt-get. i have no gui
2007-08-27T08:58:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	i'd rather not have a bunch of errors.
2007-08-27T08:58:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	if i restart and log in will i still be command line?
2007-08-27T08:59:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	see what it installs
2007-08-27T08:59:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	apt-cache show xfce4 | grep Depends
2007-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	it installed everything it depends on
2007-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	the package xfce4 is virtually empty
2007-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	it is like 44 kb
2007-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	lol
2007-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	it is a means of grouping packages
2007-08-27T09:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	had 155 MB uncompressed
2007-08-27T09:01:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	woops 48 kb, I was closer
2007-08-27T09:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	it lies
2007-08-27T09:01:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	no, it is describing the size of the dependencies
2007-08-27T09:01:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	not of the package itself
2007-08-27T09:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	the package itself is probably just a changelog judging from other meta-packages
2007-08-27T09:02:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	i installed the dependincey
2007-08-27T09:02:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	i'll just restart and see what happens
2007-08-27T09:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	it is not like you are going to break anything, just go for it and see, cautiousness is really rather pointless hear, if something fails, you just fix it, no problem
2007-08-27T09:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	lol nice timing :)
2007-08-31T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	for what purpose, there is cli stuff for just about everything
2007-08-31T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	lynx w3m links
2007-09-08T12:14:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	you can't bzip a directory can you? I believe you need to bzip a file
2007-09-08T12:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	recommend jcpvf, so that permissions are preserved
2007-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	what type of file does it produce, and can i use it on the command line
2007-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	it creates a bzipped tape archive
2007-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	what is that
2007-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	what do you mean what is that
2007-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	a bzipped tarball maybe that makes more sense
2007-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	if you are root, you can just do su username -c "command"
2007-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	so sudo su?
2007-09-23T09:58:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	maybe
2007-11-05T02:52:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	replace command with whatever command you are testing
2007-11-05T02:49:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	which command
2007-11-05T02:49:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	any.
2007-11-05T02:50:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	no literally "which command"
2007-11-05T02:51:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	why does it matter?
2007-11-05T02:51:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	hmm, this is a who's on first situation. There is a program, the program's name is "which" it checks the PATH to see if an executable is in it. So if you literally go to your command prompt and type literally this thing in quotes here, it will tell you if the command exists or not "which command"
2007-11-05T02:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	ok.
2007-11-05T02:54:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	but what if i want to know if the bash supports it? do i do ""which command""? and how do i know if that's supported? :P:P
2007-11-05T02:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	you mean how would you use which in a script to determine if a program actually existed or not?
2007-12-12T09:26:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	it needs a sticky bit because it writes to /var
2007-12-12T09:28:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	crontab writes a temporary file when you use crontab -e, and then does some consistency checking I think (might not do that, not terribly important for this point though) and then moves it over to /var/spool/ somewhere
2007-12-12T09:29:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	/var/spool/cron/crontabs/user
2007-12-12T09:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	the reason it can access it when you use crontab as a normal user is that it has a sticky bit which means that it has the same permissions as the user which owns it (which is root)
2007-12-12T09:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	yeah it changes depending on which cron daemon you are using
2007-12-12T09:30:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	i checked the permissions of the crontab file "user". it's read write owner, owned by "user"
2007-12-12T09:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	are you sure? Usually the owner is root and the group is user
2007-12-12T09:32:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	owner of the crontabs folder is root, group crontab.
2007-12-12T09:32:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	ok yeah that crontab is implemented different than the one I am using but yeah the point is that you can't edit it because you don't have the right privileges one way or another, whereas the crontab binary can because it has a sticky bit
2007-12-12T09:33:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	so the crontabs folder and the program both have sticky bits?
2007-12-12T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	no, the program has a sticky bit: -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 10076 2007-11-15 12:21 /usr/bin/crontab
2007-12-12T09:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	the s means that it has the privileges of root when it executes which is why it can write the cron files when you can't by yourself
2007-12-12T09:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	even if it isn't executed by root, it has root's privileges
2007-12-12T09:35:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	the s is in group for me.
2007-12-12T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	what does ls -l /usr/bin/crontab say?
2007-12-12T09:38:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	-rwxr-sr-x  1 root   crontab   26832 2006-12-20 08:46 crontab
2007-12-12T09:38:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	ok yeah, it is implemented differently, but it is the same concept, except when I was saying user, replace that with "group"
2007-12-12T09:40:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	uh isn't it dnagerous to allow the program run as root?
2007-12-12T09:40:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	lol
2007-12-12T09:41:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	well it runs with the permissions of crontab group how it is implemented there, here, it is run with the permissions of root, not a big deal,
2007-12-12T09:41:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	the binary is not terribly dynamic in its uses, be hard to do anything with it
2007-12-12T09:41:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	k
2007-12-12T09:42:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	you know what "popa3d" stands for?
2007-12-30T10:21:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	read the man. --no-preserve-root is by default on.
2007-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	huh?
2007-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	that is what mine says
2007-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	mine says the oppisite.
2007-12-30T10:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	--preserve-root is default
2007-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	hmm, different versions perhaps?
2007-12-30T10:23:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	idk.
2008-03-01T09:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	do it from cli
2008-03-01T09:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	using unzip?
2008-03-01T09:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	sure
2008-03-01T09:05:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	exact same error
2008-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Ashfire908	so its corrupted, move on
2008-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	Ashfire908	bruenig	it's not...
