2005-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	nikkia		token, kill -9 the sshd's for that user
2005-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	nikkia		token, *after* disabling the account, of course
2005-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	that's awesome
2005-07-04T15:20:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	that won't catch the pre-PTY priv sshd like proc 1850 above
2005-07-04T15:20:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	it wont?  I was quite sure I did it today and saw those
2005-07-04T15:20:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	the pre-PTY sshd runs as root here
2005-07-04T15:22:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	tbh, i bet you only need to kill the pre-PTY priviledged sshd to drop the connection anyway
2005-07-13T15:13:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	what about people who want to delete past the start of the line?
2005-07-13T15:14:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	i use emacs, i already said its a great environment once you're used to it :P
2005-07-13T15:18:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	to be l33t in emacs you also need to have written at least one major .el file too :)
2005-07-13T15:18:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	yeah, that too
2005-07-13T15:19:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	now that is ridiculous
2005-07-13T15:53:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	personally, i wouldn't put the dvorak stuff in there
2005-07-13T15:55:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	when i was looking for a job last, i had about 12 different resumes
2005-07-13T15:56:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	=\  is it that hard?
2005-07-13T15:56:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	each one tailored to presenting a different set of skills as the 'key', each potential employer got the resume most suited to their needs
2005-07-13T15:56:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	i dunno, its just a trick i was told to use, and it helped, i think
2005-07-13T15:57:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	you don't need to be dishonest, you just need to make sure that your skill set presented in the resume most suits the job its for
2005-07-13T15:58:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	noone's going to dive thru a list of OS sysadmin tasks to find that you say you can program C at the bottom, when they want a developer, for example
2005-07-13T15:58:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	that's why I put C near the top
2005-07-13T15:59:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	I thought that by listing my computer skills, after they'd heard I've admin'd several flavors of unix/linux, they would trust me to use their cash register
2005-07-13T16:03:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	tailored to *american english* is what you mean
2005-07-13T16:03:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	what ever
2005-07-13T16:03:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	which is also its biggest downfall, imo
2005-07-13T16:06:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	there is only one official dvorak though, and the others work to a variety of effectiveness, IME
2005-07-13T16:07:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	no, querty takes a lot more movement.  I can really feel that
2005-07-13T16:08:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	*shrug*, my fingers stay on the home row 99% of the time, the movements are minimal
2005-07-16T15:20:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	yes, use find
2005-07-16T15:21:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	find . -type f
2005-07-16T15:22:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	wow thank you
2005-07-16T15:33:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	is find -type f to find their creation date or modification date?  It doesn't seem to be giving me the right results for modification date
2005-07-16T15:33:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	type f = all files
2005-07-16T15:34:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	uh...  I wanted it sorted by date
2005-07-16T15:38:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	you're not going to be able to do it solely with find...
2005-07-16T15:39:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	yeah, the tricky part there is sorting on date
2005-07-16T15:39:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	 i don't think 'sort' offers a 'by date' option
2005-07-16T15:40:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	 if you can get the date in unix 'seconds from epoch' and padded with 0s, you could sort based on that easily
2005-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	tbh, i'd be tempted to write a 'date sort' script in python, it wouldn't be much work
2005-07-16T15:44:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	there you go, format that so it has 0 padding and sort'll happily sort it
2005-07-16T15:44:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	can I do that with printf?
2005-07-16T15:46:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	erm, dunno, what's the current date in epoch-absolute format ?
2005-07-16T15:46:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	find the number of digits in the current epoch-absolute, and add a couple of digits for safety :)
2005-07-16T15:48:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	i use find for a lot of stuff, its amazing what you can do with it, really
2005-07-16T15:49:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	s/^..........// :)
2005-07-16T15:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	oh yeah, thanks
2005-07-16T15:49:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	there's probably a way to use a numeric multiplier on . but i can't remember it, and its easy to type 10 .s :)
2005-07-16T15:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	you're pretty clever
2005-07-16T15:51:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	wow...  I could do this all in a single line, that's amazing
2005-07-16T15:53:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	hm?
2005-07-16T15:54:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	if you're just trying to cut the first 10 chars from every line though, you should just be able to do   cut -c10-
2005-07-16T15:57:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	that's tiny :P
2005-07-16T15:57:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	let me know when you start having to use line continuations to get around bash's input length limit :)
2005-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	1024 characters, iirc
2005-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	i've written single (well, piped) commands that long before :)
2005-07-16T15:59:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	show me
2005-07-16T16:00:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	i don't have them in my history
2005-07-16T16:00:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	bash's history sucks anyway, rewriting a shared history between bash instances is something i have on my todo list :P
2005-07-16T16:00:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	i normally have 10-20 bash instances running, and only 1 gets to write the history file :/
2005-07-16T16:01:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	yeah, as i said, rewriting bash to use a shared history between instances is on my todo list :)
2005-07-16T16:02:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	it also means some changes to ! tho, to allow you to pull out items based on date/time and/or terminal used
2005-07-16T16:08:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	know any reason why it would have cut out some of the wrong characters there?
2005-07-16T16:08:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	no idea, unless your sort output wasn't right
2005-07-16T16:09:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	yeah, my sort wasn't right...  maybe it's in my printf command to find
2005-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	gimp annoys me sometimes :/
2005-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	hows that?
2005-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	mostly because i keep running into things that end up with 'hmmm, i'll have to write ANOTHER gimp-script :/'
2005-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	and there is no decent 'glow' plugin by default
2005-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	in fact, i find that the 'drop-shadow' plugin with offsets of 0,0 makes for a better glow than the 2 standard ones, which is a bit sad
2005-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	ah.  Well, I've never really used those features, except on text.  And I draw pretty much with the black pen
2005-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	my scripts are almost all to do with layers, since i often edit images with 50-200 layers :/
2005-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	for example, since there's no 'turn all layers except this, off' option, i had to write one as a script
2005-07-16T16:46:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	our artist supplies artwork with all graphical elements as seperate layers, positioned as they should be on the screen
2005-07-16T16:46:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	 so if we have 200 graphical elements on the screen, it'll be 200 layers
2005-07-16T16:47:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	tbh, i asked him to start supplying artwork like that, because its a lot easier to cope with than seperate .psd's per element, and then having to guess where they're supposed to be positioned
2005-07-16T16:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	yeouch, why so many?  Heh, what I want to do some day though, is make a drawing program with a completely different concept of layers.  One that would allow you to avoid using layers for most of the things people use them for
2005-07-16T16:47:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	200 sprites on a screen isn't a lot
2005-07-16T16:48:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	bear in mind, that things like push buttons will be 2-3 sprites, normal, pushed, and disabled
2005-07-16T16:49:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	btw, i think that concept of not using layers is flawed, 95% of the power of gimp and photoshop comes from effective use of layering :)
2005-07-16T16:50:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	what I mean is a system that would intelligently slice things for you based on the lines you draw, in a vector-like way, so that fills could be handled as if they were separate layers, but in a much quicker way...
2005-07-16T05:09:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	calling kylix a game did seem a bit odd :P
2005-07-16T05:09:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	oh oops, what is it then?
2005-07-16T05:09:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	the linux equivalent/version of delphi
2005-07-16T05:10:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	oooh hehe sorry, thought the name sounded game-like, and assumed if it wasn't in the repos it must be a game
2005-07-16T05:46:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	man rename
2005-07-20T16:54:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	you know, it never asked me for a resolution either, that i remember, just defaulted to the highest it discovered via EDID iirc
2005-07-20T16:59:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	the unix world really needs symbolic runlevels, and it needs them badly :)
2005-07-20T16:59:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	having to remember 0=single on one system and 0=halt on others, isn't good
2005-07-20T05:06:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	command what?
2005-07-20T05:06:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	nikkia	bash
2005-07-20T05:06:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	if you mean bash,   echo <ctrl-v><ctrl-g>
2005-07-20T05:07:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	you could probably also escape it with \07 or something
2005-07-20T05:09:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	printf takes it ok tho
2005-07-20T05:09:00.000Z	nikkia	tiglionabbit	so 'printf \\07' does what is expected
