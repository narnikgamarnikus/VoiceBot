2005-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	crimsun		then stop acting like one
2005-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Good point.  :-)
2005-07-09T07:27:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I'm afraid to ask, but what does that mean?
2005-07-09T07:27:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	problem exists between keyboard and chair
2005-07-09T12:06:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	have you adjusted /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-07-09T12:07:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I will in a minute...
2005-07-09T12:09:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I am at the point where it's going to install the base system.  If I overwrite debootstrap with the one from ubuntu with the ubunt CD loaded, will it do the right thing?
2005-07-09T12:10:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	sure.
2005-07-09T12:10:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I'll give that a go.
2005-07-09T12:11:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Oh wait, it won't call it right will it?
2005-07-09T12:12:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	why mess with that? Just dist-upgrade from Woody.
2005-07-09T12:12:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Last time I tried that, I had no PCMCIA when I rebooted.
2005-07-09T12:13:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	what prevents you from booting from the CD?
2005-07-09T12:15:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	so what prevents you from using something like http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/ ?
2005-07-09T12:15:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	ubuntu initrd is too big for 32M RAM.
2005-07-09T12:17:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	I'd try the netboot option if you haven't already.
2005-07-09T12:17:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I just untar that and boot from it?
2005-07-09T12:17:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I would love to.
2005-07-09T12:18:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	not exactly. You can find standard netboot instructions for Debian on the Web; they're nearly drop-in for Ubuntu.
2005-07-09T12:18:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Okay, I'll try it.
2005-07-09T12:23:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I have already copied vmlinux and initrd.gz to hard drive partitions and booted those.  Will this netboot require less RAM?
2005-07-09T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	are you using the versions in that directory?
2005-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	These are smaller?
2005-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	try the netboot-specific versions
2005-07-09T12:25:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	K.
2005-07-09T12:28:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	That IS a smaller ramdisk...
2005-07-09T12:28:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	:)
2005-07-09T12:37:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Oooo, exploded badly.
2005-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	where?
2005-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Do you know the fancy aptitude command for upgrading from woody?
2005-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	It ran out of memory and kernel paniced.
2005-07-09T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	all you need to do is change /etc/apt/sources.list once the base system is installed, then update && dist-upgrade
2005-07-09T12:42:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I did that before and had no PCMCIA afterwards.
2005-07-09T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	was the pcmcia-cs package installed?
2005-07-09T12:42:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I did the update over pcmcia.
2005-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	When I rebooted, it said no pcmcia present.
2005-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	but was it removed for some reason via the dist-upgrade?
2005-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I am not sure.
2005-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I'll install woody again.
2005-07-09T12:46:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Maybe the new mod-dep made the old kernel forget how to find pcmcia?
2005-07-09T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	hmm,  but module-init-tools should have been installed as part of the dist-upgrade.
2005-07-09T12:48:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Do they require 2.6 kernel?  Cause it booted 2.2
2005-07-09T12:48:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	module-init-tools is for 2.6, yes. modutils for 2.0-2.4
2005-07-09T12:49:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Okay, then it didn't install or make itseklf boot from the right kernel.
2005-07-09T13:04:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Maybe the only problem before was booting the wrong kernel.  But the i686 libc6 sounds like a bomb.  Is there an i586 libc6 on the CD?
2005-07-09T13:05:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	there's the standard i386 (non-suffixed) libc6
2005-07-09T13:06:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	One thing I tried was installing to a USB drive on another system and then copying that over the network.  But the install system was i686 and my i586 died when it booted trying to use i686 libs.
2005-07-09T13:06:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	At least I think that was what happened.
2005-07-09T13:07:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I still have the ubuntu USB stick if you think I can tweak it to use the right libraries?
2005-07-09T13:09:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	perhaps if you remove libc6-i686 from the usb stick it may work. I don't know offhand, because I've not tried such a procedure.
2005-07-09T13:10:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I was just thinking that.  Well, this will be reaady to boot in a minute.  I'll do a grub-install before I try it.
2005-07-09T13:11:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	woody installed the kernel and drivers before debootstrap.  Maybe I have to do it manually from the CD before I reboot?
2005-07-09T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	worth an attempt
2005-07-09T13:12:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	So I need kernel, kernel-modules?
2005-07-09T13:12:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Danke
2005-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	there's also dh-make-perl
2005-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Okay, ase system installed successfully.
2005-07-09T13:32:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Is there any way I can install linux image and modules from the CD without having to resolve all the dependencies manually?
2005-07-09T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	you only need linux-image-2.6.10-5-386 and linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-386
2005-07-09T13:33:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I'm getting dependency problems.
2005-07-09T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	on libc6?
2005-07-09T13:34:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	no, let me look.
2005-07-09T13:39:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	It says linux-image-386 depends on linux-image-2.6.10-4.386
2005-07-09T13:42:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	I only stated linux-image-2.6.10-5-386 and linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-386
2005-07-09T13:42:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I know, that's what I am trying to do.
2005-07-09T13:42:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	and what is holding them up?
2005-07-09T13:42:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	It says the meta package depends on the -4 image.
2005-07-09T13:42:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	apologies, but I will have to sleep soon
2005-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I should too.
2005-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	hmm, why are you trying to install the metapackage?
2005-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I am not.
2005-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	That's what happens when I try toi install the image package you specified.
2005-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	linux-image-2.6.10-5-386 ?
2005-07-09T13:44:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	linux-image-386_2.6.10-5_i386.deb
2005-07-09T13:45:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Is that wrong?
2005-07-09T13:46:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	linux-image-386_2.6.10-5_i386.deb
2005-07-09T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	that looks right
2005-07-09T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	shouldn't be getting a dependency on -4- if you're installing -5-
2005-07-09T13:47:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	But alas, I am.
2005-07-09T13:47:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	are you referring to linux-image-386?
2005-07-09T13:47:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I am using dpkg on a .deb I copied from the CD.
2005-07-09T13:47:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	I cht
2005-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	maybe if I used the aptitude -r methid from woody it would install the kernel?
2005-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	never tried that.
2005-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Can I just download the kernel from somewhere?
2005-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	sorry, but I'm about to collapse
2005-07-09T13:50:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Me too!  :-)
2005-07-09T13:50:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	you can extract vmlinuz from the deb using dpkg-deb -x
2005-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Hell, even that is complaining about dependenciues.
2005-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	crimsun	James_Ward	g'luck, gotta go
2005-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	it has usr/share/doc in it?
2005-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	Thanks!
2005-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	James_Ward	crimsun	You tried!
