2010-06-02T05:09:00.000Z	DasEi	freezway	sry, i missed your response of my last question
2010-06-02T05:09:00.000Z	DasEi	freezway	I'm no gfx guru; what's your orininal request ?
2010-06-02T05:10:00.000Z	freezway	DasEi	 Yesterday I tried to compile my kernel. To make a long story short, my graphics drivers got messed up. So I did a reinstall, completely wiping the drive, and I STILL can't get my native resolution. (1920x1080) and am stuck at 1360x768... HELP. I am using the 195 nvidia driver. Before this all happened I had the native resolution
2010-06-02T05:10:00.000Z	DasEi	freezway	ah, I see, you tried the nvidia-settings, I assume ?
2010-06-02T05:11:00.000Z	freezway	DasEi	yes
2010-06-02T05:12:00.000Z	DasEi	freezway	is your monitor detected correctly ?

2010-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	freezway	DasEi	it seems to think it 1024x768, but i can set it to 1360x768... I need 1920x1080
2010-06-02T05:17:00.000Z	DasEi	freezway	if you go   xserver-configuration,  is your monitor detected right ?
2010-06-02T05:19:00.000Z	freezway	DasEi	yes, but incorrectly
