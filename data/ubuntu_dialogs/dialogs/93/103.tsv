2004-11-06T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	er, applications:/// in nautilus
2004-11-06T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no, you can make menu items ther
2004-11-07T11:08:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	he sold thawte for a large amount of money, yes
2004-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	k7
2004-11-07T11:23:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no, you tell apt you want it and it downloads and installs it for you
2004-11-07T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	you need to know what package you want
2004-11-07T11:24:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	apt-cache search linux-image k7
2004-11-07T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no, it is still available
2004-11-07T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	the default will be the new kernel tho
2004-11-07T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no
2004-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	wiki.ubnutulinux.org/BinaryDriverHowto
2004-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	what process?
2004-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	have you read that page before?
2004-11-07T11:27:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	then just read that page and do what it says
2004-11-07T11:28:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	then yes, you need to do the trivial work of installing the module package again
2004-11-07T11:28:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	how do you mean?
2004-11-07T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	apt-get what? resitricted-modules? yes.
2004-11-07T11:30:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no
2004-11-07T11:31:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	yes, I know
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	sysv-rc-conf
2004-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	it's a package, dude.
2004-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	trolling
2004-11-16T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	so is slashdot
2004-11-17T09:44:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	it's a bug in the nvidia drivers
2004-11-17T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	install libmikmod2
2004-11-17T09:48:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	But is the first time this bug affects me this is my 3rd install of ubuntu
2004-11-17T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	yes, it's a very weird bug
2004-11-17T09:49:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	"he just talks a lot."  LOL LOL LOL
2004-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	it's "hoary".
2004-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	I know is hoary
2004-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	I was just kidding
2004-11-17T10:13:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	sorry I just want to let people use their rights LOL
2004-11-17T10:13:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	He asked to have more packages
2004-11-17T10:13:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	it's not about rights
2004-11-17T10:13:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	yeah I know sorry
2004-11-17T10:15:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no
2004-11-17T10:16:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	ok I'm sleepy sorry
2004-11-17T10:17:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no
2004-11-17T10:17:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	AHHH I give up then
2004-11-17T10:18:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	Thats what I meant to say
2004-11-17T10:22:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	of course it can be removed
2004-11-17T10:23:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	yes, but it's safe to remove ubuntu-desktop
2004-11-17T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	it means you won't get future ubuntu desktop packages installed automatically
2004-11-17T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	it's there to Depend on all the basic desktop stuff, so you only need to install one package
2004-11-17T10:30:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	ubuntu-desktop has a new version should I upgrade to it in hoary?
2004-11-17T10:30:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	it removes something like libfam0.......
2004-11-17T10:30:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	not unless you're already running hoary
2004-11-17T10:31:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	don't think it depends on anything more interesting yet
2004-11-17T10:31:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	it says to be removed libdfam0c102
2004-11-17T10:32:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	is it safe to remove?
2004-11-17T10:33:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	if you agree that it's not forcing anything you want out, yes
2004-11-18T09:55:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	Spyware isn't the reason I changed actually it was for having a more powerfull desktop. But spyware makes me never return to Windows again ;)
2004-11-18T09:55:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	ah, heh :-)
2004-11-18T10:08:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	so is slashdot
2004-11-18T06:13:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	nvidia is even worse
2004-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	no accelration at all, in fany of the free drivers
2004-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	in what way?
2004-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	I play every windows game better in Linux Nvidia has the best Linux support in a driver there is for Linux
2004-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	on intel
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	if you use a kernel version they support
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	for now
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	on AMD
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	amd, intel, samf diff
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	what happens when they stop updating it?
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	Why would they?
2004-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	you think they will update drivers for your card forever?
2004-11-18T06:16:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	nope just like it happens in windows
2004-11-18T06:16:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	the current drivers are good enough to stay forever like that
2004-11-18T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	erm, no
2004-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	the current drivers will not work with new kernels
2004-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	well they update everytime a new kernel comes out
2004-11-18T06:17:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	I'm asking if you think they will do that forever
2004-11-18T06:18:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	well why wouldn't they? If they want to keep selling their cards they will?
2004-11-18T06:20:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	do any companies continue updating drivers for years after they've sold the hardware?
2004-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	But nvidia has one driver that is general for every card so 6800 cards driver still gives a boost to geforece 2 cards
2004-11-23T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	you don't need one
2004-11-23T09:48:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	why?
2004-11-23T09:49:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	cdrom has a line in fstab
2004-11-23T09:49:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	gnome-volume-manager will handle it
2004-11-23T09:49:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	so i just put a dvd and magic it starts?
2004-11-23T09:49:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	you don't need to mount it to play it
2004-11-23T09:50:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	when you install it, totem will start
2004-11-23T09:59:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	It does not started my dvd
2004-11-23T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	computer -> desktop -> removable media
2004-11-23T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	is it enabled?
2004-11-23T09:59:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	do you havea working dvd player installed?
2004-11-23T10:00:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	nope it doesn't appear there as I don't have an fstab line for it
2004-11-23T10:00:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	ignore fstab
2004-11-23T10:01:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	OK
2004-11-23T10:01:00.000Z	kensai	bob2	i'll keep trying thanks
2004-11-23T10:01:00.000Z	bob2	kensai	you don't see anything about dvds drives in that config box?
