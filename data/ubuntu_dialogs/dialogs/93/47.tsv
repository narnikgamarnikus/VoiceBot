2007-12-27T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	no, that dir is debian/ubuntu specific

2007-12-28T11:11:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	cheers!
2008-01-04T10:59:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	hahaha not sentient yet?
2008-01-04T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	who says an it can't be sentient

2008-01-09T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	which nano? rhythmbox (and i asume the current libgpod) broke my 3d gen
2008-01-09T09:21:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	the latest nano? the workaround has been around for a week or so now
2008-01-09T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	ah, it's on that page then? looking
2008-01-09T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	you gotta remember, I'm old, I don't move as fast anymore
2008-01-09T09:21:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	dont believe it :}

2008-01-10T10:33:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	that is the experience I had with the mbr with success
2008-01-11T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	yeah, I saw the æ–‡ after I did the just in case :)
2008-01-11T10:14:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	is that page significantly better than the ubuntu one?
2008-01-11T10:15:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	the dual boot one? seems more clearly laid out imo
2008-01-11T10:16:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	should I desist and only use the ubuntu one? just curious
2008-01-11T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	no, I look for good ones to give out. I used to ask them if I could crib from them for ubuntu pages, but haven't done much wiki work recently.
2008-01-11T10:18:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	okay; cheers!

2008-01-23T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	and I've been trying to be good too
2008-01-24T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	thanks, another torrent on that site is bad I guess
2008-02-10T01:01:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	the nvidia driver has no effect on console
2008-02-10T01:02:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	clearly but he wants it for a file server with x apparently
2008-02-10T01:02:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	he said command line only
2008-02-10T01:04:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	just paying back for your catches

2008-02-21T09:11:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	hahaha
2008-02-21T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	he had to explain it to me, rflol

2008-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	sorry I missed that ;]
2008-02-28T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	key there is the debian repo thing. It's not modified for ubuntu
2008-02-28T09:41:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	for devourer's issue? sorry was spacing out.. ;]
2008-02-28T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	no, alandd . I ran across this a few days ago, had the guy put the postinst on pastebin. but wols_ 's idea may very well work. I just don't tell people to add debian repos.

2008-03-04T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	I read that one, saw all the foolish things going on, and just built libgpod and gtkpod in local.
2008-03-04T10:06:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	nice! ;]
2008-03-08T13:47:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	oh, that's gotta become a factoid
2008-03-08T13:48:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	haha thanks

2008-04-27T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	do you think I should have been faster on the trigger with xce11 ?
2008-04-27T11:37:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	haha nah--just did not like some of his terminology (me overtired and cranky is the real problem) ;]
2008-04-27T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	:)
2008-05-27T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	yeah, it's almost enough to make me puke

2008-05-27T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	ohh, hadn't caught that yet. I filed a bug against envy-gtk, it messed up the sources.list. Did get fixed fast, though

2008-06-25T06:41:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	yeah; its in the restricted modules now so no more breakage at kernel upgrades
2008-06-25T06:42:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	ah, the true problem with it. Thanks
2008-06-30T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	like I said, it takes some of the fun out ;p
2008-06-30T08:18:00.000Z	bazhang	nickrud	:)

2009-10-11T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	bazhang	I'm having a brain fart. Do you remember offhand what the command is to show held packages?
