2010-10-06T04:52:00.000Z	dborba		Suggestions for an application to "stream" thoughts from my head into a wyswyg editor?
2010-10-06T04:53:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	there's a reference in one of the wiki articles about neural interfaces that's quite promising (no joke)
2010-10-06T04:53:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	sadly, afaik, those are still dealing with just keystrokes & mouse movement :(
2010-10-06T04:54:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	true, but i said "promising," not "in production" or "complete" lol; any suggestions on my issue?  Need to log in to the mounted drive via livecd so i can modify my grub file; booting from HDD doesn't let me specify noapic before it craps itself, and the livecd doesn't have perms to modify the file
2010-10-06T04:55:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	oooh - i actually had to deal with something similar. are you getting a read only problem?
2010-10-06T04:56:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	pretty much.  it's an obvious permissions issue.  i can open and edit the file, but the livecd doesn't have write perms.  it's a fresh, clean install of 10.04
2010-10-06T04:56:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	due to toshiba's FUBAR'd ACPI system, you have to run noapic to get it to boot, but the install doesn't give me the chance to do so, so i need to use the livecd to make the change in grub lol
2010-10-06T04:56:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	you gotta remount the drive. gimme a second and i should be able to find how to do it
2010-10-06T04:57:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	thanks mate, googling while asking, but i'm a fan of simultaneous effort for faster solutions lol
2010-10-06T05:00:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	so my issue is that I actually bombed my fstab & had no cd-rom. struggled a bit to find the right way to enable read/write. i think this one didn't work for me, but try: mount -o remount,rw /
2010-10-06T05:03:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	can't find it in the fstab lol.  looking up how i can specify all it needs in the command (been a while, i'm rusty)
2010-10-06T05:03:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	you don't need to mess with the fstab - that was specific to my problem just remount your drive on the command line
2010-10-06T05:04:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	where did ubuntu mount the drive to? I'll tailor a command for it
2010-10-06T05:04:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	/media/[long alphanumeric string]
2010-10-06T05:05:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	alright  gimme 1 second
2010-10-06T05:05:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	appreciate it
2010-10-06T05:05:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	alright - just to make sure I'm not completely off on what the problem is tell me what you get for a mount -l
2010-10-06T05:06:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	standby for pastebin
2010-10-06T05:07:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	http://pastebin.com/6HBpydcW
2010-10-06T05:09:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	from that it looks like your hd is not mounted at the moment. can you see inside it right now?
2010-10-06T05:11:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	sry lol, updated it now, refresh the page, it's the last line.
2010-10-06T05:11:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	from the looks of that, it IS mounted as rw, but for some reason i can't modify the /etc/default/grub file on it
2010-10-06T05:13:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	the last line I see (17) is a virtual file system. i still don't see your hd
2010-10-06T05:14:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	if you try to modify directly /etc/default/grub you're gonna run into problems because that's a virtual file
2010-10-06T05:14:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	last line should be 18.  it reads:
2010-10-06T05:15:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	end goal is simply to apend "noapic" to the line that normally just reads "quiet splash" for the default boot
2010-10-06T05:15:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	Ah - couldn't get it from refreshing... But yea - are you trying to modify /media/965a5f1e-062e-4c9c-8dd6-a2666cadbbd2/etc/default/grub?
2010-10-06T05:15:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	that's the one you want...
2010-10-06T05:15:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	yup, and it's saying i don't have perms when i try to overwrite it
2010-10-06T05:16:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	maybe i'm overcomplicating it.  gonna try to copy the file, edit the copy, then paste it over (maybe it's just the CLI editor that doesn't want to do it)
2010-10-06T05:16:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	ummm - that's pretty weird. you are using sudo to modify it right?
2010-10-06T05:17:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	of course lol.  exactly command was: sudoedit /media/[that long string]/etc/default/grub
2010-10-06T05:18:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	just making sure :P - sometimes people try silly things. try to sudo touch something in that folder and see if it lets you
2010-10-06T05:20:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	nothing happens.  i enter: sudo touch ./grub (cd'd into the right dir, don't worry), and it just gives me another line
2010-10-06T05:22:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	did the m-time change? just seeing if you can write at all to that location.  alternatively "sudo touch test" and see if an empty file test gets made. (just delete right afterwards if it does). if it doesnt you can't write to that folder at all
2010-10-06T05:23:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	maybe i'm going about it the wrong way.  if i create my own grub on the VFS from the livecd, can i load that into the actual grub bootloader on the HDD?
2010-10-06T05:23:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	it created test
2010-10-06T05:24:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	got some new info.  i can create files in that folder, but once created, i no longer own them, and cannot write to or remove them
2010-10-06T05:25:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	you should definitely be able to modify that file then :\ you can certainly try to replace the file if you think that's easier. id first try to do a "sudo mv grub grub.bak" and see if it lets u move it
2010-10-06T05:25:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	that's awfully weird. i mean, you shouldnt own them because you are creating them with sudo (so they are owned by root) but you should still be able to edit them
2010-10-06T05:25:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	that worked rofl
2010-10-06T05:25:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	you're telling me? lol
2010-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	i should now be able to copy over MY version of grub; let you know if it works
2010-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	seems like you should. extremely retarded though :\
2010-10-06T05:27:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	nope, can't copy it, but i'm doing it from the GUI, not with sudo, so that might be why. stand by
2010-10-06T05:28:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	this is so bizarre...
2010-10-06T05:30:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	got it.  had to create the file on the VFS, then sudo mv it into the HDD's etc/default folder; freaking insane >_< lol
2010-10-06T05:30:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	im thinking it might be an issue with sudoedit... did you at any point try plain sudo vim ?
2010-10-06T05:32:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	no, i'm one of those losers that's never got the hang of emacs or elvis; i'm spoiled on nano lol
2010-10-06T05:33:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	haha - my sudoedit pulls up a gimped version of vi. that's the only thing i can think of tho. since everything else you did with sudo worked
2010-10-06T05:34:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	alright, now the final trick is figuring out how to run update-grub from the livecd and get it to update the HDD lol
2010-10-06T05:34:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	tried sudo update-grub and sudo update-grub /dev/sda and both return "cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?)
2010-10-06T05:40:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	update-grub takes no arguments & it uses default filesystem locations
2010-10-06T05:41:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	yeah, seeing that.  looks like i should just need to chroot into the drive, do some binds, and then do the deed.  googled and found something promising, but will let you know if i run into trouble.  thanks again for all the help
2010-10-06T05:43:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	np - if you really need to generate the cfg file using update-grub keep in mind it's just a wrapped for grub-mkconfig.
2010-10-06T05:45:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	but isn't the /etc/default/grub just there for reference?  you need to use update-grub to actual load that into the bootloader, don't you?
2010-10-06T05:46:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	pretty close. more less the grub.cfg is generated/updated from the /etc/default/grub when you run update-grub
2010-10-06T05:48:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	when you run update-grub i believe all it does is "grub-mkconfig --output=/boot/grub/grub.cfg
2010-10-06T05:49:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	i see.  *shrugs* i figure i'll go through and do it anyway, as that's what my instructions said.  toshiba laptops are notoriously difficult to make linux behave on, and i've got a step-by-step for getting it working on this one, and it included that, so i figure, may as well lol
2010-10-06T05:50:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	are the instructions meant to be done while logged in from a live cd? ever since grub2 came out it's kind of a pain to configure it from a live cd. in the past there were actually some nice guis
2010-10-06T05:51:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	no, the instructions were for ubuntu 9-something, he didn't run into the issue i am where i couldn't get it to boot from HDD, thus the workaround for this step, so it'll boot from HDD and i can continue with the instructions
2010-10-06T05:52:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	most of it i recognize, and covers some of the issues i found workarounds for myself when i first tried doing this last fall.  isn't too hard to modify it for the slight changes in 10.04
2010-10-06T05:53:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	I see. well if you run into issues booting up let me know. I think the changes might not get updated on the grub.cfg on the hd
2010-10-06T05:53:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	will do; brb, grabbing a smoke
2010-10-06T05:58:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	not sure if you saw ZykoticK9's message: " if you are using a livecd and trying to modify your HDs grub you need to be sure you follow the directions for chrooting (involving the various required mounts) from the !grub2 factoid link."
2010-10-06T05:58:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	yup :)
2010-10-06T05:58:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	thanks
2010-10-06T05:59:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	ZykoticK9, afk a few, need my cigarette while i wait for the livecd to boot up again
2010-10-06T06:10:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	ZykoticK9, looks like the update to grub took; rebooting now and will find out
2010-10-06T06:14:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	ZykoticK9, no joy; looks like i also need to disable acpi for it to behave >_< really not liking toshiba right now lol
2010-10-06T06:15:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	that is pretty frustrating
2010-10-06T06:16:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	extremely.  hopefully i can figure out how to load the fan and thermal modules automatically at boot, so i can maintain mostly-normal use while having acpi permanently disabled
2010-10-06T06:18:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	what's the issue with toshiba's acpi that causes issues? The acpi on my lenovo works fine
2010-10-06T06:19:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	honestly don't know specifically, just that disabling ACPI resolves pretty much all problems i've had with the thing, and googling shows that APIC and ACPI are common problems on the satelite series laptops.  this thing's a toshiba satelite l505d (first run of win7-pre-installed systems, bought it on win7 launch day.)
2010-10-06T06:19:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	something about toshiba's ACPI being implemented differently / improperly than is normal
2010-10-06T06:20:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	I see. Dumbasses :X I've got to say I've been pretty lucky with ubuntu working out of the box on every laptop I have installed it on for the last 2 or so years :D
2010-10-06T06:20:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	honestly, that's the reason i went with ubuntu in the first place, i'd always heard it's pretty much the most laptop-friendly distro out there
2010-10-06T06:20:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	exceptions for a couple sound issues & wacom
2010-10-06T06:21:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	i use gentoo on my desktops
2010-10-06T06:21:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	(well, non-gaming desktops; i CBA to bother dual-booting w/e my current gaming machine is)
2010-10-06T06:22:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	sadly I've for the most part given up computer gaming over the last few years just to be free of windows :P
2010-10-06T06:22:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	the irony is that when I play it is on a 360 :X
2010-10-06T06:23:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	i'm too much of a gamer to give it up, especially with awesome titles like EVE Online (which works in linux, thankfully), FFXI, FFXIV, and of course titles like ArmA2, Crysis, etc.
2010-10-06T06:23:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	for shame! why aren't you on PS3?  It plays 99% of the good games on 360, has equal or superior performance, free online, more and better exclusives, and, oh yeah, it's not M$? lol
2010-10-06T06:25:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	victory.  so much easier to modify files when i'm not an idiot and i actually chroot properly into the HDD lol
2010-10-06T06:25:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	much better hardware on the PS3 but no1 had how to program it down pat until recently. Since every1 I knew had a 360 it's just where i went. Now with the new stuff coming out for the ps3 im definitely thinking about getting one
2010-10-06T06:26:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	well shoot rob.klebes@gmail.com when you get one and add SporkWitch on your PS3 lol; you as well rusivi
2010-10-06T06:26:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	rusivi, but there was a (valid, if rude) request that we drop this subject, so let's move on lol
2010-10-06T06:30:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	http://homeport.org/~bcordes/satellite-l500-install.html scroll down to "fixing ACPI"
2010-10-06T06:30:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	that's the install walkthrough i'm using, and it mentions exactly what's causing the acpi issue
2010-10-06T06:32:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	wow - that's pretty whacky - easy fix though
2010-10-06T06:32:00.000Z	SporkWitch	dborba	yup, now i just need to figure out how to update-world in ubuntu lol
2010-10-06T09:44:00.000Z	dborba	SporkWitch	doing things as root is bad? Are you sure everyone doesnt just sudo passwd?
