2007-07-19T06:58:00.000Z	genii	aricz	This means they are not being detected at a hardware level then
2007-07-19T06:58:00.000Z	aricz	genii	yep, that's what I've been suspecting too.. since dmesg | grep CD gives me nothing
2007-07-19T07:00:00.000Z	genii	aricz	I'd suggest pulling the drive out and testing it in another box first to see if it's defective
2007-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	genii	aricz	If it works in the other box we know it's a software issue
2007-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	aricz	genii	it worked with w9x and wxp.. and also this distro, for some time :)
2007-07-19T07:03:00.000Z	genii	aricz	You may want to try going to BIOS on the box, making sure that all HD are set to "auto" or "autodetect"
2007-07-19T07:08:00.000Z	genii	aricz	frogzoo is right , when both are set to cable select (factory defaults these days) and one fails, the other automatically is supposed to become the master drive. but it sometimes goes screwy because the defective one is still on the cable sending erratic signals etc. So the one at end of cable should be master, in the middle of cable should be slave
2007-07-19T07:10:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Could be you jarred something loose inside, like a connector or so.But unlikely. I've smacked my box hundreds of times with no ill effects other than sore hands
2007-07-19T07:11:00.000Z	aricz	genii	hehe, I don't know, it happens sometimes the bios won't find the DVD-rom or CD-rom.. but now that's not the problem, since they both starts up at startup (spins, I can eject etc etc)
2007-07-19T07:12:00.000Z	genii	aricz	If you smacked it exactly next to one of the CD/DVD drives you may have messed the drive itself up but not likely
2007-07-19T07:13:00.000Z	aricz	genii	or, they used to change.. sometimes the DVD-rom was working, sometimes the CD-rom.. never both at once
2007-07-19T07:13:00.000Z	genii	aricz	That symptom sounds like the master/slave/cable select issue
2007-07-19T07:14:00.000Z	aricz	genii	ok, so I should just shut down, open my box.. and change jumpers.. are those jumpers easily understandable? :)
2007-07-19T07:15:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Usually there are 3 sets of pins.Next to power is master, next is slave and one next to ribbon is cable select. USUALLY. But look at stamping on metal of case or writing on circuit board to make sure
2007-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Is the cd still remianing in there set to master and on the end of the cable?
2007-07-19T07:45:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Not really
2007-07-19T07:46:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Just look at the ribbon and see if it's plugged in the end or middle
2007-07-19T07:47:00.000Z	genii	aricz	If you have the cd on the end of the ribbon and set (as best you can) to master, and then the OS still doesn't see it, then shut down and swap the drives. eg, remove CD, insert DVD same spot, then see again if OS sees it etc
2007-07-19T07:51:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, normally on most of them the Master is the one next to the power cable
2007-07-19T07:51:00.000Z	genii	aricz	So for testing, put a single drive on Master, on the end of the cable
2007-07-19T07:59:00.000Z	genii	aricz	I'm still around :)
2007-07-19T08:01:00.000Z	genii	aricz	The jumper should be on the one closest to the power plug for the drive
2007-07-19T08:01:00.000Z	aricz	genii	oh, so I should put it on the RIGHT ?
2007-07-19T08:01:00.000Z	genii	aricz	If the one saying "master" is on then don't mess with it. Just put it on end of cable
2007-07-19T08:02:00.000Z	genii	aricz	with older drives it was standard next to power plug. but these days it can be anywhere.Sometimes there is a picture on the sticker on top of the drive to show proper jumper settings. but many times not
2007-07-19T08:03:00.000Z	aricz	genii	I should put in 'slave' instead? because it was that "wire" which was connected to both my CD-rom and DVD-rom.. there are 2 "outlets" on the same wire.. one MASTER, and one SLAVE
2007-07-19T08:04:00.000Z	genii	aricz	the many-pinned wire is a ribbon :)
2007-07-19T08:04:00.000Z	genii	aricz	So drive on end of ribbon. Jumper put next to power plug connector
2007-07-19T08:04:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Good
2007-07-19T08:05:00.000Z	genii	aricz	So if it will work in hardware at all, this is proper settings for testing
2007-07-19T08:06:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Thats fine, just let it continue
2007-07-19T08:07:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Don't worry about dmesg/drivers right now
2007-07-19T08:08:00.000Z	genii	aricz	After machine gets booted, pls pastebin the contents of file: /etc/fstab
2007-07-19T08:12:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Backup your fstab and in a minute I will give you a modified one to try
2007-07-19T08:15:00.000Z	genii	aricz	To edit the file you need of course admin privelege. So: gksudo gedit /etc/fstab   then replace contents with paste from here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30444/
2007-07-19T08:16:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Basically I just commented out the slave drive entry and made the cdrom to auto from noauto
2007-07-19T08:17:00.000Z	genii	aricz	After you save the changes, put in some standard type of cd like an old AOL one or so
2007-07-19T08:17:00.000Z	genii	aricz	No reboot needed
2007-07-19T08:18:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK give it a minute to see it and maybe popup a window
2007-07-19T08:19:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Was the cd in there before you made the changes or did you just put one in after?
2007-07-19T08:20:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, perfect
2007-07-19T08:34:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Does ls /dev/hdd  show it there?
2007-07-19T08:21:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Yup :) Give it maybe 60 seconds to see if you get a popup that shows it sees it. If you get no popup, then go to the dir it is supposed to get mounted to and see if you can list whats on the cd
2007-07-19T08:22:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, do: mount /media/cdrom1
2007-07-19T08:23:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, so not seeing it at hardware level still then :/
2007-07-19T08:24:00.000Z	genii	aricz	No, there is not anything else on the ribbon to set or so on just the little manual jumpers
2007-07-19T08:25:00.000Z	genii	aricz	The only jumpers which would ever need messing with would be master/slave/CS and we already did that part. So not much more to do for that drive
2007-07-19T08:26:00.000Z	genii	aricz	The next thing would be then to repeat this whole process with the other drive (swap them out)
2007-07-19T08:26:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK then. You will need to power off then do it, then power on again
2007-07-19T08:32:00.000Z	genii	aricz	I need to be on phone a couple minutes but I'm around
2007-07-19T08:33:00.000Z	genii	aricz	sudo eject -t /dev/hdd
2007-07-19T08:35:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Damn
2007-07-19T08:36:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, well, now to repeat the entire process but with the CD drive only.eg; swap the drives. Power off, swap, CD=master,end of ribbon etc. You know the drill :)
2007-07-19T08:37:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK I'll be around
2007-07-19T08:42:00.000Z	genii	aricz	YAY
2007-07-19T08:43:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Are you tring some standard iso9660 cd in it?
2007-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Not yet
2007-07-19T08:45:00.000Z	genii	aricz	First do: ls /dev/hdd   and see if that exists
2007-07-19T08:45:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, so then now: ls /dev/hdc and see if that exists
2007-07-19T08:46:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, so do the gksu gedit of fstab then just change hdd for now to hdc
2007-07-19T08:46:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Then eject/reinsert tray with a cd
2007-07-19T08:47:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Did you get some error about fsck and / or root filesystem being unclean at boot?
2007-07-19T08:48:00.000Z	genii	aricz	You booted to hard drive and not to CD, yes?
2007-07-19T08:50:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Bleh I currently gone blank, trying to rememner remount into rw method
2007-07-19T08:52:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Ah. I am thinking now the cut/paste into fstab got cropped over lines. eg: what should have been only a single lineis now over 2 lines (not good)
2007-07-19T08:53:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Actually you should be able to, by remounting / with read write
2007-07-19T08:53:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Just trying to remember safe way to do this :/
2007-07-19T08:58:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, I think you should at this point just run the filesystem check and let fsck clean and make it readable/writeable for next boot other than trying the unmount/remount rw method.
2007-07-19T08:59:00.000Z	genii	aricz	It will just be safer
2007-07-19T09:01:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Actually the better (proper way) would be to do: reboot    then hit ESC when grub begins. then choose safe kernel  to boot. After that comes up you can safely run fsck without any arguments. After it cleans the drive, do again: reboot then ESC and choose the one it was using normally
2007-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	genii	aricz	 When I told you earlier to backup your fstab file, did you do that?
2007-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	genii	aricz	fine. Then since hardware now sees DVD, put in the livecd, boot to that and then mount the drive there, copy the backup over the defective one
2007-07-19T09:13:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Here?
2007-07-19T09:13:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Did you do reboot/grub/safe ?
2007-07-19T09:15:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, well try then: umount / ; mount -o rw /
2007-07-19T09:16:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Yes, with the ;
2007-07-19T09:21:00.000Z	genii	aricz	For now just worry about getting / clean :) We return to CD/DVD after that
2007-07-19T09:22:00.000Z	genii	aricz	You have more tty then?
2007-07-19T09:22:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK good. does:  mount          command show / as being rw ?
2007-07-19T09:24:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Did you try to copy the backup over the faulty one yet? (fstab)
2007-07-19T09:25:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Yup. Trying to still remember how unmount/remount rw successfully when in ro mode :/
2007-07-19T09:27:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK: umount / ; mount -o rw /dev/hda1 /
2007-07-19T09:30:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK, try then just: mount -n -s -o rw /
2007-07-19T09:34:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Ah, OK Falstius Disregard safemode comment
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Doing some research on this, AFK
2007-07-19T09:40:00.000Z	aricz	genii	now I managed to edit /etc/fstab .. and fix line 9 and 10
2007-07-19T09:41:00.000Z	genii	aricz	You need to keep a livecd around my friend
2007-07-19T09:48:00.000Z	genii	aricz	wb
2007-07-19T09:48:00.000Z	genii	aricz	I am soon going for lunch (10 minutes) just so you know
2007-07-19T09:49:00.000Z	genii	aricz	OK so back to CD/DVD LOL
2007-07-19T09:51:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Well, it should not be mounting there, but good to know is at least working somewhat
2007-07-19T09:52:00.000Z	genii	aricz	Should be mounting into the directory /media/cdrom0 or /media/cdrom1
2007-07-19T09:52:00.000Z	genii	aricz	So you see it on your desktop
