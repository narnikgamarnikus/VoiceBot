2005-07-21T13:02:00.000Z	mjkelly93		guys i figured out my problem now,   i install the fglrx package via synaptic but the kernel doesnt load the module
2005-07-21T13:02:00.000Z	mjkelly93		if the package installs correctly how can i instruct the kernel to load the module at bootup?
2005-07-21T13:03:00.000Z	mjkelly93		i got a ATI 9250
2005-07-21T13:04:00.000Z	mjkelly93		i think that the ATI driver dont support my 9250 otherwise id be done already
2005-07-21T13:05:00.000Z	mjkelly93		anyone got experience with FGLRX out there?  specifically the ubuntu package?
2005-07-21T13:05:00.000Z	mjkelly93		yeah me2     james im on day 7 now
2005-07-21T13:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	james: have you guys read this page? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-07-21T13:08:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	heres my response to that                          homeslice@ubuntu:~$ sudo depmod -a ; sudo modprobe fglrx
2005-07-21T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	rebooting won't help
2005-07-21T13:13:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	im getting the same fatal error after a reboot
2005-07-21T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ok
2005-07-21T13:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	stand by...
2005-07-21T13:14:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	i had the fglrx drivers working when i installed them from the ATI site, but they dont support my 9250 card... *im pretty sure*,         the ubuntu package installed drivers in a couple completely different places than the ATI package did
2005-07-21T13:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	is the 9250 a very recent card?
2005-07-21T13:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ah, ok
2005-07-21T13:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	standby again (sorry ;)
2005-07-21T13:15:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	thats why im just gonna focus on the ubuntu registered program and not mess around with the ati packages anymore,     sure take your time     ive been tryin this for about 4 days straight now i can wait a lil while
2005-07-21T13:16:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	the ubuntu package installed about 10 files in /usr/X11R6, the ati packages didnt install anything there?
2005-07-21T13:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	what's the output of 'dpkg -l xorg-driver-fglrx| tail -1'   ?
2005-07-21T13:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	hmm
2005-07-21T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	hmm
2005-07-21T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ok, let me go find where that file is
2005-07-21T13:18:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	before i unloaded the ATI version fglrx, there would be a successful modprobe
2005-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	did you install the ubuntu version before or after uninstalling the ati version?
2005-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ah
2005-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	i think i know what might have happened
2005-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	the fglrx.ko file is in the linux-restricted-modules package
2005-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	the ATI version overwrote that, and then erased it when uninstalled
2005-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	you just need to reinstall linux-restricted-moudles
2005-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	 didnt think of that,   ill use apt-get and specify my kernel version right?
2005-07-21T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	yeah
2005-07-21T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	you know how to do this?
2005-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	yip
2005-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	i think there's a --reinstall flag -- check the --help or 'man apt-get'
2005-07-21T13:24:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ok that reinstalled correctly from the CD
2005-07-21T13:24:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ok, try the 'depmod -a; modprobe fglrx' thing now
2005-07-21T13:25:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	 uh oh
2005-07-21T13:25:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	   homeslice@ubuntu:~$ depmod -a; modprobe fglrx
2005-07-21T13:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	remember not to paste too much here
2005-07-21T13:25:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	i know    if it would have been another line or 2 i woulda used pastebin
2005-07-21T13:26:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	whaddya think about that error?
2005-07-21T13:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	as OdiiN said, you need sudo for both of those
2005-07-21T13:26:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ok didnt see that
2005-07-21T13:27:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	nothing
2005-07-21T13:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	um
2005-07-21T13:27:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	should i reboot then try those commands?
2005-07-21T13:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	this is new on me
2005-07-21T13:28:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	well then we're both learning hehe
2005-07-21T13:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	the depmod -a worked ?
2005-07-21T13:28:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	 yes
2005-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	i can't tell why that module does not load; rebooting is an option
2005-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	im gonna reboot then try those commands again as per described on the wiki                     ill brb
2005-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	if fglrx is still in /etc/modules, it *should* load on boot
2005-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	its there   ill brb
2005-07-21T13:30:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	its actually listed there 4 seperate times hehe    does that matter?
2005-07-21T13:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	only once is fine
2005-07-21T13:36:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	modprobe didnt load any errors
2005-07-21T13:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	cool
2005-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	now you just need to tweak /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	you need to change 'ati' to 'fglrx'
2005-07-21T13:39:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	im gonna do that right now,  modprobe and depmod both ran smoothly
2005-07-21T13:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	you should not need to run those again, especially if fglrx is listed in /etc/modules
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ok      well kern.log says it loaded, modprobe says its loaded, ubuntu says its the correct version and has been verified to work on my radeon 9250, all i gotta do is restart now, wish me luck ill be back in 2 minutes
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	also, you don't need to reboot again. let me know when you've tweaked xorg
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	woah ;)
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	 :)
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	have you tweaked xorg.conf ?
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	yes    im gonna shut down gdm and restart it
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ok
2005-07-21T13:40:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	brb
2005-07-21T13:47:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	didnt work, it hung like usual
2005-07-21T13:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	hmm
2005-07-21T13:48:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	hmmm is right    wtf   =(   i had my hopes up there
2005-07-21T13:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	sorry. have you looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log  ?
2005-07-21T13:48:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	it hangs before it gets to write to the log, ive tried like 5 different ways to get to read that but it doesnt get to write to it
2005-07-21T13:50:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	i think im just about out of ideas    i just cant see whats going wrong?
2005-07-21T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	i'm out of ideas too, sorry.
2005-07-21T13:51:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	can u think of anywhere else i can get advice?
2005-07-21T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ubuntuforums, and the mailing lists
2005-07-21T13:52:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	i tried ubuntuforums like 3 times but noone there helped
2005-07-21T13:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	ok, the mailing list. standby
2005-07-21T13:54:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ok   i dont know what that is so ill wait for ya here   just lemme know

2005-07-21T15:29:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ya think i can get this fglrx nonsense working if i recompile a kernel following this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelHowto
2005-07-21T15:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	i don't know, sorry
2005-07-21T15:31:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ok ill give it a shot i have nuttin to lose
2005-07-21T15:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	do you have a reason to think it will help?
2005-07-21T15:32:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	no   none at all
2005-07-21T15:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjkelly93	you can try, but i wouldn't be too optimistic
2005-07-21T15:34:00.000Z	mjkelly93	HappyFool	ok
