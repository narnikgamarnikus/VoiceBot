2007-05-24T12:37:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	looking
2007-05-24T12:20:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	VC-1 is the successor to WMV9. I thought that Blu-ray and HD-DVD used VC-1 and MPEG-4 but maybe they use WMV9 also.
2007-05-24T12:21:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	WMA9 != WMV9
2007-05-24T12:21:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	so what do I do ?
2007-05-24T12:23:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	how do I play it ?
2007-05-24T12:23:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	First I would try to determine what codec it is using. (I'm not sure of a tool to do that off hand, what does 'file' say?)
2007-05-24T12:23:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I would guess that you would need more recent version of FFMPEG (maybe from CVS)
2007-05-24T12:24:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	Source..:HDDVD
2007-05-24T12:24:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	WMV-HD
2007-05-24T12:24:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	it is a file from news groups
2007-05-24T12:25:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	Does the site work for you because it does not for me http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/
2007-05-24T12:25:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Okay, you probably need newer version of FFMPEG
2007-05-24T12:25:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Yes it works
2007-05-24T12:25:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	If you get to that page you will see that they announced support for WMV-9 and VC-1 on March 9
2007-05-24T12:26:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	does that mean that I will have to do compiling and stuff, I am scared of that
2007-05-24T12:27:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	You will probably have to compile the sources, unless someone has packaged a deb.
2007-05-24T12:28:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	I cant understand why doesnt the site open up. Just times out.
2007-05-24T12:28:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Sorry, can't help you there. Works for me
2007-05-24T12:29:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	what was that site with debian packages? I forget the name, but all the latest stuff is usually there in debian package format
2007-05-24T12:30:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	You might actually have to compile MPlayer (which includes FFMPEG sources I believe)
2007-05-24T12:30:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	packages.debian.org ? But I doubt you will get cutting edge packages from there.
2007-05-24T12:31:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	nah, that is not the site, I think it was something like get debian or soemthing
2007-05-24T12:32:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Here are Mplayer's package listings. http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/projects.html#unofficial_packages
2007-05-24T12:33:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	this one http://www.getdeb.net
2007-05-24T12:34:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	so does that mplayer source has latest codec needed ?
2007-05-24T12:34:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	The subversion snapshot should have it.
2007-05-24T12:36:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	VLC explicitly states that it has it in their nightly builds
2007-05-24T12:37:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	hmm, perhaps I will look into it
2007-05-24T12:37:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	They might have pre-compiled binaries.
2007-05-24T12:43:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD
2007-05-24T12:44:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I can't find binaries for VLC
2007-05-24T12:44:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	let me see
2007-05-24T12:44:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	this does dont work http://nightlies.videolan.org/  suing this source, vlc cannot install dependencies
2007-05-24T12:44:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	That link probably isn't very helpful.
2007-05-24T12:46:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	I will try this comman svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk mplayer
2007-05-24T12:54:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	I just got mplayer, not sure if it is the latest one but I can play the video, no audio though
2007-05-24T12:55:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	If you run it from the command line what does it say? Particularly regarding audio
2007-05-24T12:55:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	let me try
2007-05-24T12:56:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	what is the command? maplyer movie name ?
2007-05-24T12:56:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	mplayer movieName
2007-05-24T12:56:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	It may have automatically been built without support for audio codecs that you didn't have the developer libraries for
2007-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Yeah, (gmplayer will give you graphical control)
2007-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	"Cannot find codec for audio format 0x162.

2007-05-24T13:03:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	^ Is that the error you get
2007-05-24T13:06:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	http://pastebin.ca/507795
2007-05-24T13:09:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	That pastebin is from mplayer?
2007-05-24T13:10:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	totem
2007-05-24T13:12:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Totem uses gstreamer so you would need the corresponding gstreamer libraries (I thought you had video working in mplayer. Do you have video in totem?)
2007-05-24T13:13:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	here is mplayer http://pastebin.ca/507807
2007-05-24T13:13:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	brb in 15, gone to eat.
2007-05-24T13:13:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I may have to leave. I'll try to leave a message
2007-05-24T13:17:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I think that you didn't enable support for win32codecs
2007-05-24T13:24:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Maybe I'm wrong about not enabling it. Do you have win32codecs installed? It should install /usr/lib/wma9dmod.dll (I have it)
2007-05-24T13:27:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	how do I get win32codecs ?
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	Error
2007-05-24T13:30:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	(BTW you can only use win32codecs if you are on x86 I believe)
2007-05-24T13:30:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	mplayer -ao alsa file.wmv works for me
2007-05-24T13:30:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	hold on ,reading how to get win32codecs
2007-05-24T13:30:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I don't know why that is, but it works
2007-05-24T13:31:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Anyway, it does work. I just tried it. Stepping away for a few minutes. But will read messages addressed to me when I get back.
2007-05-24T13:32:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	It does not work for me as the audio of the file that I have is not normal wmv or wma  it is wmv9 High Definition
2007-05-24T13:33:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I downloaded the file (iguana?). It works for me with -ao alsa and win32codecs
2007-05-24T13:33:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	yes iguana
2007-05-24T13:34:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	hold on, let me check on those win43codecs
2007-05-24T13:35:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	from the link you gave me https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html   where specifically do I look ?
2007-05-24T13:35:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	It should just be a matter of enabling multiverse repository
2007-05-24T13:36:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	I think they are enabled by default. And once it is enabled, how do I get the codec ?
2007-05-24T13:37:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	The package name is w32codes
2007-05-24T13:37:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	The package name is w32codecs
2007-05-24T13:38:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	strange, I do not see it in synaptic. And I think that multiverse is enabled in Feisty
2007-05-24T13:43:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	reading all the links, I still cant get Win32codecs, none of the guide have it
2007-05-24T13:43:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Sorry, it used to be on the RestrictedFormats page. Someone has apparently taken it off

2007-05-24T13:51:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	it works !
2007-05-24T13:51:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	but mplayer gives me the error that too many packages are in the buffer while playing
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	also audio is a bit behind the video
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Mplayer crashes?
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	no, just a error pops up, I can close it
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	with this command "-ao alsa "  audio is synched fine
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	The sample I have doesn't produce any such error.
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Okay good. Anyway I gotta go
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	that happens when I fast forward search
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	callidusfox	soothsay	thanks for the help !
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	I deleted the file now so I can't test anymore but when I fast forwarded I don't think there was any error (was using subversion trunk mplayer without GUI)
2007-05-24T13:57:00.000Z	soothsay	callidusfox	Anyway, sorry I gotta go
