2010-05-03T10:13:00.000Z	Jon_		question
2010-05-03T10:13:00.000Z	Jon_		i'm installing via the text based installer, and i'm at the !!Partition Disks portion of the install....
2010-05-03T10:14:00.000Z	Jon_		i've previously partitioned my internal harddrive with BootCamp, and have selected the Bootcamp partition, which is currently labeled as Do Not Use, and i want to use it.  can anyone tell me what i should do to change it?
2010-05-03T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Are you on the main "see all of your partitions" menu, or have you aleady gone 'into' that partitions menu?
2010-05-03T10:16:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	I've backed out to the ! Ubuntu installer main menu.... if you can tell me what to do from there that would be helpful
2010-05-03T10:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	You'll go back into that partitions submenu thing, then hit enter on "do not use" and it'll change to give you more options.  Or, maybe you choose the part about "Format" from No to yes.  And it'll give you a bunch more choices
2010-05-03T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Sorry, I'm doing this from memory, so I don't remember exact verbage, but I do know what I'm doing, honest ;)
2010-05-03T10:17:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i have 'Detect Disks' 'Partition Disks', i'm guessing i should detect....?
2010-05-03T10:18:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	when i detect disks, it gives me the disks it sees, then i can select the current Fat32 bootcamp partition
2010-05-03T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Oh, you've backed out too far.
2010-05-03T10:18:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	again, i'm guessing, but i'm selecting that fat32 partition, and will type what i see next
2010-05-03T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	you've essentially goneinto the 'expert mode' list of things-to-do-during install, which isn't a problem,
2010-05-03T10:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Sounds good.  You'll eventually go to "partition disks"
2010-05-03T10:19:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	the header on this page reads, ! Partition Disks, and partition settings as Name : Bootcamp, and Use as: do not use, however, i DO want to use it, so what do i do?
2010-05-03T10:20:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i hit enter on 'do not use' and it gives me a list of options, that's what i need to know, which one to choose
2010-05-03T10:20:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	shall i list them?
2010-05-03T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Change Use As to "/"
2010-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i can't hit /, i can only hit enter, and then i have that list
2010-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Sorry, one of those options is "/" meaning "root"
2010-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Unfortunately, it's different than "/root"
2010-05-03T10:21:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	 there is no 'root' in this list, shall i list what IS there?
2010-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Hold up.  Is there a place where you can specify that you want to format it?
2010-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	It'd be on that same subscreen thing
2010-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	let me reiterate, i'm on an iMac 27"
2010-05-03T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Then we're at the wrong screen, but sure, go ahead and list the options it gives you.
2010-05-03T10:23:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i previously partitioned the drive with BootCamp
2010-05-03T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Oh, I'm sorry.  Is one of the options "Ext3" or "Ext4"?
2010-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	list as follows:  Ext4 journaling file system, Ext3 journaling file system, Ext2 journaling file system, ReiserFS journaling file system, JFS journaling file system, XFS journaling file system, Fat16 file system, Fat32 file system, swap area, Reserved BIOS boot area, EFI boot partition, physical volume for encyption, phyisical volume for RAID, physical volume for LVM, and 'do not use the partition'
2010-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	right, choose Ext4
2010-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Then below that, for mount point, you want "/"
2010-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	and that Ext 4 will use the bootcamp partition and the ubuntu install should proceed?
2010-05-03T10:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	It will use that partition, yes.
2010-05-03T10:27:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	I chose Ext4, and have parition settings, Name Bootcamp, Use as Ext4 journaling file system, mount point is none, mount options is default, label is none, reserved blocks is 5%, typical usage is standard, bootable flag is off
2010-05-03T10:27:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	none of those items are editable, i can't change any to /
2010-05-03T10:32:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i'm at a loss, any idea what i should do?
2010-05-03T10:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	You can't get it to change Mount Point to /?
2010-05-03T10:32:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i can affect no changes in the page that i'm currently on
2010-05-03T10:33:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	mount point is currently, by default, "none"
2010-05-03T10:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Then I'll hazard a guess that you're doing something wrong, perhaps at the wrong step, or chosing the wrong partition, or I'm not sure what.
2010-05-03T10:34:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i'm not sure what i could have done wrong, as i strictly followed your suggestions and reported back the results
2010-05-03T10:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Although I've never heard of something like this before
2010-05-03T10:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Right, I'm unfamiliar with Bootcamp, perhaps Jordan_U can help you, he seems more familiar with Macs in general.  I just know the alternate CD
2010-05-03T10:36:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	let me restate that i'm on page [!!] Partition disks   you are editing partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,0,0)  (sda).  This partition is formatted with the FAT 32 file system.  All data in it WILL BE DESTROYED!  Partition settings, INDENT  Name: Bootcamp, use as : Ext4 journaling system, mount point: none, etcetc
2010-05-03T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Yes, I know where you are.  In the normal install process, you'd change mount point to / and then be on your way.  I'm not sure what would be causing you to not be able to do so.
2010-05-03T10:37:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i don't know either, except that hitting / isn't changing none to /
2010-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	no, you hit enter, and then you'll be given a dropdown of options (to select with the arrow key)
2010-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	hitting ENTER on 'none' has allowed me to select / from a list of options to change it to
2010-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	ok, that worked, mount point is now /
2010-05-03T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	You're good to go then.
2010-05-03T10:39:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	now i have 5options from the bottom
2010-05-03T10:39:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	 just choose 'done setting up this partition;?
2010-05-03T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	correct
2010-05-03T10:40:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	thank you, proceeding
2010-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	ok, i selected that, and i'm back to the previous screen, the overview...i now 'Finish partitioning and write changes to disk?
2010-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	If the partitions all look right, yeah.
2010-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	(you didn't accidentally tell it to partition one of your other drives, etc)
2010-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	the only change to anything has been to the bootcamp partition, which now has a mount point of /
2010-05-03T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	right. then yeah, continue.
2010-05-03T10:42:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	You have not selected any partitions for use as swap space.  Enabling ............ what did i not do correclty?
2010-05-03T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	It wants a partition to house it's stuff (/) and then swap space to use as extra RAM, does OSX already have a swap partition?
2010-05-03T10:44:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	no swap partition in OS X, i have 4gb of RAM currently, with room for 12GB more, is 4GB sufficient?
2010-05-03T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Do you intend to hibernate?
2010-05-03T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	4GB would be sufficient for everyday use, the only reason you'd need swap of any significant amount is to hibernate
2010-05-03T10:46:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i'm attempting to install Ubuntu on the newest model of 3.06Ghz iMac 27" with the upgraded 4850 video card, i don't think i'll have the need to hiberate ubuntu
2010-05-03T10:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Alright, then you'll be fine without any swap
2010-05-03T10:47:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	Creating ext4 file system for / in partiion #3 of SCSii
2010-05-03T10:47:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	installing the base system, 9% and counting
2010-05-03T10:59:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	installtion seems to be proceeding well.... i hope once all this is done i end up with video :)
2010-05-03T11:40:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	are you still here?
2010-05-03T11:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Whats up?
2010-05-03T11:40:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i'm to the Configuring grub-pc part of the install, and don't know how to proceed
2010-05-03T11:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	That'd be a question for someone who knows macs and things, I have no idea how it differs from regular GRUB
2010-05-03T11:41:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	recall that in installed on the bootcamp partition
2010-05-03T11:42:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	do you have a suggestion as to who i should ask?  recall earlier someone said it was no different than any other pc, while under bootcamp and formatted as fat32
2010-05-03T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	What is it asking you about anyway?  What sort of configurations?
2010-05-03T11:44:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	 it says :  [!!] Configuring grub-pc    spacespace  You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device.  The usual way to do this is to install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive.  If you prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive, or even to a floppy.
2010-05-03T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	I'd install GRUB on your bootcamp partition
2010-05-03T11:46:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	that seems to be a likely place for it, considering, however, i don't know what /dev denotes that partition, do you ?
2010-05-03T11:47:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	there's a suggestion here, that says, "/dev/sda2 will use the second partition of your first hard drive, and that seems to be relevant, considering bootcamp IS on the second partition of my internal harddrive
2010-05-03T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Earlier you said the partiton was partition #3 of sda, so that'd be sda3
2010-05-03T11:48:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	how can i confirm that?
2010-05-03T11:48:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	are you able to paste what i wrote, i don't seem to have a history that long
2010-05-03T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Well, I grabbed the output you pasted earlier, and that's what it said ;)
2010-05-03T11:51:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	ok, i'll take your word for it, would you possibly be able to tell me the outcome of telling it to install in the wrong place?
2010-05-03T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Nothing horrible would happen.  You'd have to wind up reinstalling it to the right place later most likely.  And assuming you didn't install it to /dev/sda, you won't have to worry about wiping that out
2010-05-03T11:52:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	alright, selecting continue..... cross your fingers
2010-05-03T11:57:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	the system seems to have hung itself on the last displayed message.... any ideas?
2010-05-03T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	No, it's not wrong.  But no one currently awake knows how to do it with bootcamp.
2010-05-03T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Someone who knows how bootcamp/osx/etc works can help you.  Your best course of action is to keep asking here every so often, and to ask elsewhere while you wait
2010-05-03T12:29:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	you know every step i've taken thus far, do you have any input that might salvage whatever went wrong?
2010-05-03T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	I have *zero* clue as to how Macs do their stuff, so no, I don't know how you'd get it to boot properly.  Someone who is familiar with that, on the otherhand, could probably solve your problem within five minutes.
2010-05-03T12:31:00.000Z	Jon_	Flannel	i'll ask again, do you know of anyone here who is familiar with macs?  (although, one fellow here suggested earlier that macs partitioned with bootcamp are treated like ANy other system)
2010-05-03T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Jon_	Your best bet is to ask in the forums, and to repost your question (a summary, all on one line so people can read and get an idea what your issue is) every so often (30 minutes would be a good frequency).  Sooner or later, someone will be awake who can help you (or someone on the forums will help you)
