2005-03-29T09:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	stay in #ubuntu a better class of people reside here :)
2005-03-29T10:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	there are alot of good people there but a few elitist man-page-memorizing-zobies with big egos will let you know how great they are :)
2005-03-29T10:01:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	I agree
2005-03-29T10:01:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	One guy was rude and said he was trying to help
2005-03-29T10:02:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	I told him, really, how so
2005-03-29T10:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	I stopped going into that channel like 2 years ago because of that foolishness
2005-03-29T10:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	what's wrong ?
2005-03-29T10:03:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	locks up at begin install
2005-03-29T10:03:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	Sis chipset
2005-03-29T10:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	it just freezes ?
2005-03-29T10:04:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	yeap
2005-03-29T10:04:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	hopefully, hoary will take instead
2005-03-29T10:04:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	 doesnt make sense
2005-03-29T10:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	can you change to another virtual terminal or it's a hard freeze ?
2005-03-29T10:05:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	not sure totally what ya mean, but it locks up tighter than a drum
2005-03-29T10:05:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	no cursor nothing
2005-03-29T10:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	so if you do ctrl+alt+F3 it won't change to a new terminal ?
2005-03-29T10:05:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	honestly did not try that
2005-03-29T10:06:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	I can see the screen that asks which language
2005-03-29T10:06:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	bu that is it
2005-03-29T10:06:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	maybe I will try it again today
2005-03-29T10:06:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	is hoary good enough now to do a fresh install with it
2005-03-29T10:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	sometimes a bad cd burn can do that can yo check the md5sum of your downloaded .iso file against the md5sum of the .iso on the ftp server ?
2005-03-29T10:07:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	 this is a real ubuntu cd, from them
2005-03-29T10:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	ahhh
2005-03-29T10:07:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	sorry, do you think hoary is good enough to do a fresh install,ya think
2005-03-29T10:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	you weren't messing about with your bios settings by any chance. I installed Ubuntu on my nephew's computer and after resetting the system bios it installed just fine
2005-03-29T10:08:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	 not me personally, but it is freshly built
2005-03-29T10:08:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	as a semi-file server
2005-03-29T10:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	If it is a new mobo I would check for a bios update. Maybe there were some probles that needed addressing.
2005-03-29T10:09:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	maybe I will try to install hoary directly instead of warty
2005-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	new things are being fixed all the time :)
2005-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	I agree
2005-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	I really like ubuntu
2005-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ells	is it a 64 bit system you built ?
2005-03-29T10:10:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	unfortunately not, but it is amd
2005-03-29T10:11:00.000Z	ells	LinuxJones	,the Cebron?
