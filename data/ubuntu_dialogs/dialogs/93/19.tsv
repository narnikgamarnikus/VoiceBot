2010-06-30T12:30:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	sorry incomplete link
2010-06-30T12:30:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	incomplete? its opening
2010-06-30T12:31:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	ohh i see no one has replyed to it. ok
2010-06-30T12:37:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	well i think wubi might work if he installs vnc
2010-06-30T12:37:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	wubi lets you install ubuntu inside windows
2010-06-30T12:38:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	but frankly i dont know if anyone has ever done this
2010-06-30T12:38:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	sweetpi Jordan_U but wubi wll install inside windows naa? i dont want inside windows. we need fresh clearn new installation. DUAL BOOT
2010-06-30T12:38:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	fresh install seems really difficult buddy , the system needs to boot from cd and no way his system is going to read your cd ,
2010-06-30T12:39:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	ok
2010-06-30T12:39:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	i dont know a solution, wubi might work because its installing like software to D
2010-06-30T12:39:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	but for wubi there should be first win installed naa?
2010-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	assume that no os
2010-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	of course
2010-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	indus	hmm

2010-06-30T12:44:00.000Z	indus	abhi_nav	one way is to make your friend boot the iso from his HDD
