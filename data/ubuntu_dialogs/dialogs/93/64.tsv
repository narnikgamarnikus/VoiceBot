2007-02-01T10:27:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	have you installed libdvdcss ?
2007-02-01T10:28:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	it said nothing about that in the wiki. Will install and get back to you. Thanx
2007-02-01T10:34:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	thanx missed the command
2007-02-01T12:39:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	to assign functions to the special keys, xbindkeys and xbindkeys-config are really useful
2007-02-01T12:45:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i dont think i have edgy i have 6.06. so what now
2007-02-01T12:46:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	wrt xbindkeys, that doesn't make a difference.
2007-02-01T12:47:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	thanx will try
2007-02-09T14:32:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	NTFS is proprietary and poorly documented, so it will never be entirely safe to write to it.
2007-02-09T14:35:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	I and others have answered this already
2007-02-09T14:36:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	sorry i was away and haven't been reading the wohole time
2007-02-09T14:36:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	that's just rude
2007-04-16T14:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	can i write 6.10 to dvd and boot from it or do I have to write it to CD
2007-04-16T14:09:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	I've never tried, but I'd be surprised if the DVD didn't boot just as nicely as the CD.
2007-11-06T00:24:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	what are you trying to do?
2007-11-06T00:26:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i have a ide drive that i run ubuntu from and i have installed windows onto my sata drive on the second partition and i am having trouble inserting the windows "option" on the grub menu
2007-11-06T00:27:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	http://pastebin.com/m11d1c57b
2007-11-06T00:28:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	if the SATA is the second drive (ie. you're booting from the IDE one), then you should chainload (hd1,1)
2007-11-06T00:28:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	but I doubt that Windows will be happy on a second drive.
2007-11-06T00:36:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i will swop the 2 drives but then where do i put the grub menu and how do i set it up??
2007-11-06T00:37:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	don't swap them yet -- try the chainloading suggestion first. It might work.
2007-11-06T00:39:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	do i replace "chainloader" command with this one : chainload (hd1,1)
2007-11-06T00:39:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	if Windows is on the second primary partition of the second drive, then yes
2007-11-06T00:40:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	cool then i will be right back
2007-11-06T00:53:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	well i did what you said but when i press enter on the win xp menu nothing happens
2007-11-06T00:59:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i did what you said but when i press enter on the win xp menu nothing happens what should i do next
2007-11-06T01:00:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	you mean nothing at all?
2007-11-06T01:02:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	yep! I don't get it i was at least expecting a error if it didn't work here is how it looks in the menu.lst file :  http://pastebin.com/d14037ee3
2007-11-06T01:03:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i also had root (hd1,1) in there as well but it did the same
2007-11-06T01:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	yep! I don't get it i was at least expecting a error if it didn't work here is how it looks in the menu.lst file :  http://pastebin.com/d14037ee3
2007-11-06T01:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	yep! I don't get it i was at least expecting a error if it didn't work here is how it looks in the menu.lst file :  http://pastebin.com/d14037ee3
2007-11-06T01:07:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	sorry key got stuck
2007-11-06T01:07:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	sorry, I should have noticed before: your entry is wrong. It should be after the AUTOMAGIC stuff and read like this: http://pastebin.com/d4cd47155
2007-11-06T01:09:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	will try that and brb
2007-11-06T01:09:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	thanx
2007-11-06T01:13:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i have done that and now i get this error: "error 1 : fine name must be either an absolute pathname or blocklist"
2007-11-06T01:15:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	if you copied it from the pastebin, it may just be a missing newline at the very end
2007-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i have done that and now i get this error: "error 1 : fine name must be either an absolute pathname or blocklist"
2007-11-06T01:17:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	even after you added the missing newline?
2007-11-06T01:19:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	what do you mean new line
2007-11-06T01:19:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	what you get when you hit enter
2007-11-06T01:20:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	when i go to the xp option i get the error i posted above
2007-11-06T01:20:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	this one: "error 1 : fine name must be either an absolute pathname or blocklist"
2007-11-06T01:21:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	have you added a newline character at the end of the file?
2007-11-06T01:21:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	what is the new line character
2007-11-06T01:21:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	I just told you
2007-11-06T01:21:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	what you get when you hit enter
2007-11-06T01:22:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	do you mean when i edit the menu.lst file
2007-11-06T01:23:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	yes
2007-11-06T01:24:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i get a new line
2007-11-06T01:25:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i am editing the file like is sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-11-06T01:25:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	read carefully. I didn't ask a question. The newline character is what you get when you hit the Enter key. Make sure your menu.lst file ends with such a character.
2007-11-06T01:27:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i hit enter while editing my menu.lst file and it just gives me a new line no character.
2007-11-06T01:28:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	no
2007-11-06T01:29:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	please try to understand. Between every line and the next, there is a newline character. You can't see it, you can only tell that it's there because it keeps the two lines apart.
2007-11-06T01:32:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	well i made a new line because no character appeared and new i get this error: error 12 : invalid device requested
2007-11-06T01:33:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	is Windows installed on the second partition of your SATA drive?
2007-11-06T01:34:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	well thats the way i set it up. how do i make 100% sure
2007-11-06T01:35:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	you're in ubuntu now?
2007-11-06T01:36:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	you are chatting from a different machine than the one we're treating?
2007-11-06T01:36:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	yes
2007-11-06T01:37:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	can you boot into ubuntu on the problem machine and run 'sudo fdisk -l' and pastebin the result
2007-11-06T01:37:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	will do
2007-11-06T01:42:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	i pasted the result of the fdisk command and my menu.lst file :http://pastebin.com/m630b9af4
2007-11-06T01:42:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	sorry didn't put yor name in
2007-11-06T01:43:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	I found it anyway. Now you seem to have two partitions on your SATA disk: one small, one large. Which is the one you want to boot?
2007-11-06T01:44:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	it is the small one 17 gig if i am not mistaken
2007-11-06T01:46:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	it is the small one 17 gig if i am not mistaken
2007-11-06T01:48:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	don't repeat please. I have modified your Windows entry so that it should work: http://pastebin.com/d18e539a8
2007-11-06T01:48:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	sorry, was not sure if you saw it. thank u for all the help
2007-11-06T01:48:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	brb
2007-11-06T01:57:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	now i cant boot windows or ubuntu.iget this error:  selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by bios
2007-11-06T01:58:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	that means you can't run chainload Windows off that partition.
2007-11-06T01:59:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	ok how do i fix it that i can getinto ubuntu again and how do i boot into both after that
2007-11-06T02:01:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	you will have to boot from a live CD, mount the root partition and remove the Windows entry from menu.lst
2007-11-06T02:01:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	ok i can do that. than waht do i need to do
2007-11-06T02:02:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	then you can boot ubuntu again.
2007-11-06T02:03:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	cool but how do i boot windows and ubuntu
2007-11-06T02:03:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	as for installing Windows, consult the dual-boot advice on the wiki
2007-11-06T02:04:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	thanx man njopu the eve
2008-06-30T14:28:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	I will put the backup file back
2008-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	don't go down the modeline route just yet -- freewilly's suggestion shouldn't be the first line of approaching this problem.
2008-06-30T14:21:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	see instead if you can configure your monitor through gksudo displayconfig-gtk
2008-06-30T14:23:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	'gksudo displayconfig-gtk' in a terminal
2008-06-30T14:27:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	I did what you said and this is the output: http://pastebin.org/47269
2008-06-30T14:28:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	have you made modifications to xorg.conf already?
2008-06-30T14:28:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	I tried
2008-06-30T14:29:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	that's a good way
2008-06-30T14:30:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	brb
2008-06-30T14:39:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	I'm back, my main screen is working properly buy my svideo out to my tv is making funny cooloured blocks
2008-06-30T14:44:00.000Z	soundray	Cyrus25801	I don't think I can help you much with the SVGA output issue -- please ask the channel again.
2008-06-30T14:47:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	soundray	thanx man
