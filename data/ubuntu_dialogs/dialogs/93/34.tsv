2009-03-07T04:11:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	so, where are you at? I see magcius has helped you a little now.
2009-03-07T04:11:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 but another guy helped me so now i just got installed Compiz
2009-03-07T04:12:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 Then i need to activate the effect in there somwhere , right :) ?
2009-03-07T04:13:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	yes.
2009-03-07T04:13:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	look for the magic lamp icon labeled "Effects"
2009-03-07T04:13:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	and then, as magcius told you, go to the Close Animations tab.
2009-03-07T04:15:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 im searching :)
2009-03-07T04:15:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 yes im there now
2009-03-07T04:16:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	ok.
2009-03-07T04:17:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 yes im there now, what should i do know ?
2009-03-07T04:17:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	just to check. When you close a window, does it drag away from you?
2009-03-07T04:17:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 year you can say that :)
2009-03-07T04:17:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	you should find "items" under the Close Animation tab.
2009-03-07T04:17:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	the default is Glide 2.
2009-03-07T04:18:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 i cant fin a "item" button, but i have found the Glide 2
2009-03-07T04:19:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 okay
2009-03-07T04:20:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 i have clicked on the Glide 2 and i can edit it, if it was that you were thinking about
2009-03-07T04:20:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	found it? If you did, you will be able to change the animation from a dropdown menu. Tell me if you find the Burn effect.
2009-03-07T04:21:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	No i simply cant find it
2009-03-07T04:21:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	ok. That means you have Animation addons disabled.
2009-03-07T04:21:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 Hm how do i enable it then ?
2009-03-07T04:22:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	just check the item, and get back to where we were.
2009-03-07T04:23:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	done yet?
2009-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 alright , wait a minut, im still here in the "Close Animation" and my mouse is over the Glide 2 , fomr there i frozed , i cant come any further
2009-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 i couldnt ifnd any of the "item" you said
2009-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	Animation Add-ons ?
2009-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	its next to the Animations section.
2009-03-07T04:25:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 yes i found the animation add on
2009-03-07T04:25:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	is it checked?

2009-03-07T04:26:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 but it is now .
2009-03-07T04:26:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 and then go back to where we were before after i have closed and open it ?
2009-03-07T04:26:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	ok. Now you should be able to activate the burn effect.
2009-03-07T04:27:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	well, you had no need to close and open.
2009-03-07T04:27:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 okay ill check
2009-03-07T04:28:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 YES i see it, i see burn and other new "items"

2009-03-07T04:28:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 okay ill try it :)
2009-03-07T04:29:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 it doesnt do anything, i have crossed the burn and cloed the compiz
2009-03-07T04:29:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 but when i close a window it aint burning
2009-03-07T04:29:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	hm.. did you select it as the close animation?
2009-03-07T04:30:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	does the window still drag away?
2009-03-07T04:30:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 now i have set it under the close but it aint doing it, yes its still just drag away
2009-03-07T04:31:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	find every glide 2 and tell me for which animation it is selected.
2009-03-07T04:32:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 its selected only under "Close animation"
2009-03-07T04:33:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	no other glide 2?
2009-03-07T04:33:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	hm.. you should be getting the burn effect I think.
2009-03-07T04:33:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 There are one "item" there also has the name Glide 2 should i activate that ?
2009-03-07T04:34:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	what
2009-03-07T04:35:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 Under animations, and in Close animations, there i have crossed "Burn"
2009-03-07T04:35:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 were there other things there needed to be crossed to ?
2009-03-07T04:36:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 Yes :) ?
2009-03-07T04:38:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	not check the items under "Random Effects.
2009-03-07T04:38:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 okay i have uncheked burn under random effects now
2009-03-07T04:38:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 now what are you saying, what should i do now ?

2009-03-07T04:39:00.000Z	wolter	Kamikaze	now edit the item under "Animation Selection" with the Glide 2 Open Effect
2009-03-07T04:40:00.000Z	Kamikaze	wolter	 alright, i have right clicked on "Glide2" and im in to edit it now.
