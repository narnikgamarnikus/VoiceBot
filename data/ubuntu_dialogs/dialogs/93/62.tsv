2007-02-06T08:49:00.000Z	xtknight		lol that's true
2007-02-06T08:49:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	hmm, have you heard from CursOr lately? He insisted he knew how to config his monitor, but I told him, it isn't a good sign when it blinks on and off. He told me I didn't know what I was talking about, and that is the last I've heard of him. :/
2007-02-06T08:50:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	me?  i dont know who that is ;)
2007-02-06T08:54:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	what was the release date for o.oo1
2007-02-06T08:54:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	no clue
2007-02-06T08:55:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Sep 17th, 1991.
2007-02-06T09:54:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	that doesnt seem to work on my machine (gtk is not a program)
2007-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	thank you, I was wondering how his box was working if / wasn't mounted.
2007-07-23T09:03:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	what do you mean by "active printer port"?
2007-07-23T09:04:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	you can have multiple printers on LPT01, LPT02, etc.  none is more "active" than the other necessarily.  do you want to determine which ones are plugged in?
2007-07-23T09:04:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	my friends onboard sound card died, he disabled it in bios, installed a pci lpt port, and the system isn't finding it.
2007-07-23T09:05:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	just so im getting the whole story here how is the sound card related to LPT?
2007-07-23T09:05:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	it's not, I meant printer port! :) Sorry.
2007-07-23T09:06:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	so, was a module loaded for the PCI LPT card?
2007-07-23T09:07:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	I doubt it, he can't even find the lpt card. It is plug and prey, with no jumpers.
2007-07-23T09:07:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	lpt card isn't even detected by BIOS/pci config ?
2007-07-23T09:08:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i assume this is a different pc then.  can you get him to upload "sudo lspci -vv" ?
2007-07-23T09:09:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	I don't know about bios or pci detection, and I don't have access to the machine. And we are trouble shooting via email, so I won't have the answers for a while. But you have put me on the path.
2007-07-23T09:10:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	so it wasn't listed in "sudo lshw" you say?  i find that hard to believe
2007-07-23T09:11:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	lshw doesn't list my lpt port here either, and it is working.
2007-07-23T09:11:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	hmm yea but it should list a LPT PCI card
2007-07-23T09:11:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	not for your pc, but for someone who has a LPT PCI card
2007-07-23T09:12:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	if it's not picked up by the PCI Config Space (which lshw uses), then the pci card wasn't installed properly, or the BIOS isn't setup properly
2007-07-23T09:12:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i see it in "lshal" though
2007-07-23T09:13:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Yes, for my friends box, and here I'm running the on board lpt, but you'd think it would still be listed? Roger on the setup, I'll have him double check that.
2007-07-23T09:13:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	sudo lshal | grep -i -B4 -A6 lpt
2007-07-23T09:13:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	does that list your lpt?
2007-07-23T09:14:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	also, printer ports are at /dev/lp0   /dev/lp1  /dev/lp2  etc
2007-07-23T09:14:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	lshal list a ton of stuff, let me try the grep command.
2007-07-23T09:17:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	nope, the grep command didn't list mine.
2007-07-23T09:17:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	do you have an LPT port? :p
2007-07-23T09:18:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	I'm printing through my paralell (sp) port, so yes, I do.
2007-07-23T09:19:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	And the printer is on, waiting for a job.
2007-07-23T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	ok but you have /dev/parport0 right?
2007-07-23T09:21:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Yes.
2007-07-23T09:22:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	ok well im not really sure how to help you further with this
2007-07-23T09:22:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	so the device is /dev/parportX, not lpt!
2007-07-23T09:22:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	maybe /dev/lp0 too
2007-07-23T09:23:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Ok, thanks for the help. Is there an ls command that would list parportX?
2007-07-23T09:23:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	not that i know of
2007-07-23T09:23:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	well it does on mine
2007-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	debug output is sometimes at "dmesg | grep parport" or "dmesg | grep ppdev" or "dmesg | grep lp"
2007-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Ok, I mean without the path, since my friend has no idea where is printer "is". Thanks, I have enough ideas to keep him busy for awhile. :)
2007-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Let me go search dmesg for parportX.
2007-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	the printer would definitely be at a /dev/lp  node, AFAIK.  i think parport is an older parport or something
2007-07-23T09:30:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Ok, I searched dmseg for parport*, parport*.*, and parport?.*, and it isn't found.
2007-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	/dev/usb* i think
2007-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i think it depends on the device and the module loaded, however
2007-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	will minicom configure those?
2007-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	no idea
2007-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	what kind of device?
2007-07-28T09:11:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	ok, thanks. Basic Stamp micro controller.
2007-07-28T09:11:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	it communicates over a usb port?
2007-07-28T09:12:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	That's what Pie-rate is telling me.
2007-07-28T09:17:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	he's running an app under Wine
2007-07-28T09:19:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	right, it is an app problem, not a Ubuntu problem. But stamps are cool, so I'm trying to help him. But I don't run Wine, so I guess I can't?
2007-07-28T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i dont quite understand what you mean.  seems as though the driver isnt detecting his usb->serial converter correctly.  or maybe he needs special software
2007-07-28T09:22:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	well, is is trying to configure com ports, and my Ubuntu box refers to them as ttySX ports, so there is a language barrier at work here.
2007-07-28T09:22:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	the app within wine of course uses the term COM becaues that's what it is on windows
2007-07-28T09:23:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	and how well does Wine bridge them?
2007-07-28T09:23:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	no idea
2007-07-28T09:24:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	I love hearding cats. :)
2007-07-28T09:27:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	So, here is the program flow: linux >wine>parallax interpeter>basic stamp. Which one is at fault? Here kittie kittie! ;)
2007-07-28T09:27:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	probably all of them.  if linux's driver is messed up, then everything beneath it is broken also.  lovely huh?
2007-07-28T09:29:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	Yes, how do you test a com port, can you ping it?
2007-07-28T09:29:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	probably a loopback device
2007-07-28T09:30:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	The only way I know is to issue an atz command, but how do you address the port? I can do it with kppp, but from the cli, I'm clueless.
2007-07-28T09:30:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	again no idea
2007-07-28T09:31:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	we're on the bleeding edge man! Or we need to RTFM?
2007-07-28T11:29:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	was that a reply to me?
2007-07-28T11:30:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	ya, /etc/sudoers isnt executable is it?
2007-07-28T11:30:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	 but what about the files under it?
2007-07-28T11:30:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	umm i dont know:P
2007-07-28T11:54:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	ftp is outdated, and insecure, scp is a better choice.
2007-07-28T11:54:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	lol
2007-07-28T11:54:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i dont know ive neverhad trouble with ftp
2007-07-28T11:55:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	I haven't either, but I like to minimize my risks.
2007-07-28T12:17:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	linux wouldn't run without libc
2007-07-28T12:17:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	but it runs without libc-dev
2007-07-28T12:17:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	yes.
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	my problem was apparently missing gettext devel libs not gettext itself
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	his was different i guess
2007-07-28T12:18:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	never heard of gettext dev!?
2007-07-28T12:19:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	eh you get the point it was probably something else
2007-07-28T12:19:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i dont know
2007-07-28T12:19:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i know i had a lot of trouble with it and at that point i'd compiled a million things.  surely if it was that easy..
2007-07-28T12:20:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	roger that, I thought I'd encountered most dependency problems you could find, but not that one.
2007-07-28T12:20:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	i think i was for whatever reason recompiling gcc
2007-07-28T12:20:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	and it needed new glib or libc or something i dont even know
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	ah, compiling the compiler!? That is living on the edge! :)
2007-07-28T12:21:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	lol ya
2007-07-28T12:23:00.000Z	xtknight	n2diy	real programmers decode raw ebcdic
2007-07-28T12:35:00.000Z	n2diy	xtknight	why does the sun rise in the east? ;)
