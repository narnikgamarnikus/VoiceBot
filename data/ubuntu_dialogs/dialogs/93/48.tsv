2007-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	powerserve		hi there guys!
2007-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	powerserve		is there anyone here who could help me with virtual box installation?
2007-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	you should have been here about an hour ago, that exact thing happened... what do you want to use VirtualBox for?
2007-11-15T12:33:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	sn00zer: I just isntalled it from symantic using instructions I found either on google or in the virtualbox manual pdf found on their website
2007-11-15T12:35:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	yes what is the error
2007-11-15T12:36:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	open a terminal, type groups and tell me if you see vboxusers in the output
2007-11-15T12:38:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	sir if i open a terminal what do i type into it?
2007-11-15T12:39:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	I dont' understand... do you have a terminal open?
2007-11-15T12:41:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	sir its like this when i open virtual box since i already configured a new vbox when i click start i always see that error and i couldn't get in to the program
2007-11-15T12:43:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	do this: completely close virtualbox, from a terminal type 'sudo usermod -G <your linux user name >' without the quotes, replacing <your linux user name > with whatever your linux user name is, so for instance, I would type 'sudo usermod -G vboxusers echosa'
2007-11-15T12:47:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	did you try what I said?
2007-11-15T12:49:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	would you mind guiding me again sir on what to do.. i am a newbie with just a month of experience in running ubuntu..
2007-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	do this: completely close virtualbox, from a terminal type 'sudo usermod -G <your linux user name >' without the quotes, replacing <your linux user name > with your linux user name
2007-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	ok i would do that sir
2007-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	wait
2007-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	that should say 'sudo usermod -G vboxusers <your linux user name>'
2007-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	that's what you want to type into the terminal
2007-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	ok i already did it sir i would now enter my password
2007-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	yes it will ask for a password, and you need to enter the root password
2007-11-15T12:52:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	i did it sir and nothing happened...:(
2007-11-15T13:05:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	a black and white window should open
2007-11-15T12:52:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	now type 'groups' in the terminal, and tell me what it shows
2007-11-15T12:53:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	ok sir
2007-11-15T12:53:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	already did it sir
2007-11-15T12:54:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	what does the terminal say when you type 'groups' (without the quotes)
2007-11-15T12:55:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	it just flashed and gone sir nothing was shown
2007-11-15T12:55:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	can you put it into pastebin so I can see?
2007-11-15T12:57:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	that is the output form virtualbox
2007-11-15T12:57:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	yes sir
2007-11-15T12:58:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	i closed it completely sir when u instructed me to open the terminal. after i did it, nothing was shown...
2007-11-15T13:00:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	ok, so virtualbox is not running and you are at a prompt ready to type a command.... I need you to type 'groups' (without the quotes) and press enter. It should list the groups you are in and give you another prompt
2007-11-15T13:00:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	ok i would do it again sir
2007-11-15T13:01:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	the screen just flashed sir after doing it

2007-11-15T13:34:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	same data that was given sir as placed on the pastebin..
2007-11-15T13:35:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	damn... then try what sn00zer said... 'adduser powerserver vboxusers'
2007-11-15T13:37:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	ok sir
2007-11-15T13:37:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	that should have been 'adduser powerserve vboxusers' I misspelled your name
2007-11-15T13:38:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	i corrected it sir thanks this is the output... adduser: Only root may add a user or group to the system.
2007-11-15T13:39:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	oops... forgot the sudo.. make it 'sudo adduser powerserve vboxusers'
2007-11-15T13:39:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	copy sir
2007-11-15T13:40:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	then run groups again
2007-11-15T13:40:00.000Z	powerserve	echosa	this is the output sir... powerserve is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2007-11-15T13:41:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	that happened to me too, I remember that now, the groups go overwritten, there's a way to restore it, but I don't remember.. I found it using google
2007-11-15T13:44:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	not sure, actually, maybe 'retrieve lost user groups linux' or something like that, also look around the virtualbox manual and forums
2007-11-15T13:44:00.000Z	echosa	powerserve	at this point I'm no good to you
