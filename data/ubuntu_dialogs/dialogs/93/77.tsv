2005-12-23T17:39:00.000Z	Hyperlink		Alrighty, I've got a question. I posted this on the Ubuntu forum yesterday and got no reply.
2005-12-23T17:39:00.000Z	Hyperlink		I can play audio just fine. I can play video just fine. However, when I'm playing a video there is never any audio alongside it. I've played multiple files and filetypes (avi, mpeg) with multiple media players (Totem, VLC, etc) and yet I still see people talking and no voices.
2005-12-23T17:39:00.000Z	Hyperlink		This isn't a blanket audio problem. I can play mp3s, flacs, even with the same programs. It's just that when I'm playing a video there isn't any audio, nomatter which player I use.
2005-12-23T17:40:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	paste the output from ''amixer'' onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2005-12-23T17:40:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	then give me the url
2005-12-23T17:40:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	what is amixer?
2005-12-23T17:47:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5862 that's my amixer
2005-12-23T17:50:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	eh?
2005-12-23T17:50:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	you need to prefix every line with my nick, because I'm in approximately 70 irc channels
2005-12-23T17:50:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	understood
2005-12-23T17:51:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5862
2005-12-23T17:52:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	sec
2005-12-23T17:52:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	k
2005-12-23T17:53:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	do you actually need the Headphone Jack Sense and Line Jack Sense elements unmuted?
2005-12-23T17:54:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Probably not. I'm just using speakers. I haven't really messed with that stuff. Default breezy install.
2005-12-23T17:54:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I HAVE sound though
2005-12-23T17:54:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	just not sound that goes along with avi and mpeg
2005-12-23T17:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	I know, I'm asking if toggling those changes anything. There are known quirks with your symptoms on certain chipsets.
2005-12-23T17:55:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	How would I toggle those? I'm pretty much a newbie.
2005-12-23T17:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	open a Terminal, then, amixer sset 'Headphone Jack Sense' off
2005-12-23T17:57:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	did that
2005-12-23T17:57:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Should I see if I get sound with video now?
2005-12-23T17:57:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	yes
2005-12-23T17:57:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	OK. I'll get back to you.
2005-12-23T17:59:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	still no sound
2005-12-23T17:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	ok, then revert the change you just made
2005-12-23T17:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	next I'll need strace output from your video player of choice as you test
2005-12-23T06:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	strace -o debug.txt -fF $somePlayer
2005-12-23T06:00:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	amixer sset 'Headphone Jack Sense' on ?
2005-12-23T06:01:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	yep
2005-12-23T06:01:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I entered "strace -o debug.txt -fF vlc" into the terminal. It brought vlc to the foreground.
2005-12-23T06:02:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	That's for assisting me, crimsun.
2005-12-23T06:02:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	er, thanks
2005-12-23T06:04:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	ready for the next step
2005-12-23T06:06:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	bzip2 the debug file and post it on the Web somewhere
2005-12-23T06:06:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Where did it put that debug file?
2005-12-23T06:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	wherever you were
2005-12-23T06:07:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	k
2005-12-23T06:15:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	get debug.txt.bz2 from http://esnips.com/web/andrewrsm-stuff
2005-12-23T06:17:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	get debug.txt.bz2 from http://esnips.com/web/andrewrsm-stuff
2005-12-23T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	that file is imparsable
2005-12-23T06:19:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	....
2005-12-23T06:19:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I'll upload somewhere esle
2005-12-23T06:24:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	taostrategos.com/temp01/debug.txt.bz2
2005-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Let me know if that doesn't work either...
2005-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	requires authorization
2005-12-23T06:25:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	usr: linkrjh pass: pararescue1
2005-12-23T06:27:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Is it safe to assume you were about to get the file?
2005-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	no, I lacked authorization as I previously stated
2005-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I sent you a username as password you could use.
2005-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	If you would rather not use a login, I can change dirs.
2005-12-23T06:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	change directories, please. I'm trying to assist in several channels simultaneously.
2005-12-23T06:33:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	http://www.taostrategos.com/temp01/debug.txt.bz2 [nolonger requires authorization]  (afk a second, dog's gotta potty)
2005-12-23T06:38:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	any luck? did you pass me a url?
2005-12-23T06:42:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Try that url again. I removed the authorization requirement
2005-12-23T06:42:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	http://www.taostrategos.com/temp01/debug.txt.bz2 [nolonger requires authorization] 
2005-12-23T06:42:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I was afk a sec.
2005-12-23T06:42:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	downloaded.
2005-12-23T06:43:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Great.
2005-12-23T06:43:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	don't have time this sec to inspect it; give me 5 minutes
2005-12-23T06:43:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I'll be here.
2005-12-23T06:45:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	what filename did you try to play?
2005-12-23T06:46:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	one sec
2005-12-23T06:47:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	S9E10 - The Strike.avi among others
2005-12-23T06:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	ok, if you're using vlc, ''vlc -vv'' will be more useful for me
2005-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	oh!
2005-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	have you installed vlc-plugin-alsa ?
2005-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I have not, unless it came with the greater package.
2005-12-23T06:49:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I'll apt-get it
2005-12-23T06:50:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	installing. I'll try with the plugin
2005-12-23T06:52:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	installed plugin. problem is still persisting
2005-12-23T06:53:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	should I carry out your former suggestions?
2005-12-23T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	make sure you select the alsa plugin in vlc's audio output preferences (enable advanced options)
2005-12-23T06:53:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	k
2005-12-23T06:55:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	audio:output modules:ALSA saved, still no noise
2005-12-23T06:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	ok, what sound hardware do you have?
2005-12-23T06:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	is this with Breezy or Dapper Flight 2?
2005-12-23T06:58:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	breezy
2005-12-23T06:59:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Is there a command I can use to get info about my hardware?
2005-12-23T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	lspci -v |grep -i audio
2005-12-23T07:00:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM AC'97 Audio (rev 05)
2005-12-23T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	ok, then you'll need to file a bug on bugzilla.ubuntu.com against linux with all the details you've given.
2005-12-23T07:02:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I've made it clear that I can get audio when playing a flac or mp3, right?
2005-12-23T07:03:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	This isn't just a an audio problem. My speakers make noise. The problem is that there's no audio when I play video files.
2005-12-23T07:04:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	That's why I don't think it's a hardware problem.
2005-12-23T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	I can't help you beyond sound problems; the fact that it works intermittently points to something deeper than just an application-layer issue
2005-12-23T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	are you using .asoundrc or something?
2005-12-23T07:05:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	I don't know what .asoundrc is
2005-12-23T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	ok, then that's about the extent of my troubleshooting atm. I don't deal with stuff other than audio.
2005-12-23T07:10:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Thanks for your help.
2005-12-23T09:05:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	My sound is working now. Worked after a reboot.
2005-12-23T09:05:00.000Z	Hyperlink	crimsun	Thanks for all your help man. I really appreciate it.
2005-12-23T09:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Hyperlink	good.
