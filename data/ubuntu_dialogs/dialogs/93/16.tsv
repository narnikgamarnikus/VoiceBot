2010-03-29T14:29:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Pfff... no idea... sorry

2010-03-29T14:30:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	its a big one. should i paste here on in private?
2010-03-29T14:31:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	We've got pastebin :)
2010-03-29T14:31:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	very smart! http://paste.ubuntu.com/405909/
2010-03-29T14:33:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	dpkg –configure -a
2010-03-29T14:33:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	ill run that no
2010-03-29T14:33:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	And then "sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev"
2010-03-29T14:34:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	when running dpkg –configure -a i get 'dpkg: need an action option'
2010-03-29T14:34:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Give me a sec
2010-03-29T14:34:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	I appreciated very much
2010-03-29T14:36:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	sudo dpkg  --configure -a -- << Use it too
2010-03-29T14:36:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	running now
2010-03-29T14:37:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Then try installing build-essential again :)
2010-03-29T14:37:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	succesful also
2010-03-29T14:37:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	same error from apt-get install build-essential
2010-03-29T14:41:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Appears like you have some package broken, but with that commands they're aren't fixing
2010-03-29T14:41:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	if i use synaptic is that oging to help?
2010-03-29T14:41:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Maybe try using "repair packages" in synaptic
2010-03-29T14:41:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Mark all for be repaired and click apply
2010-03-29T14:43:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	ok trying now, will report back
2010-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	did that but i think i mad a big mistake
2010-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	What happened?
2010-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	a ton of stuff was removed. Now when I run DKMS command it says 'sude: dkms: command not found'
2010-03-29T14:47:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	sude instead of sudo?
2010-03-29T14:48:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	sorry that was a mistype but it didnt work with sudo
2010-03-29T14:48:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Then try installing again with synaptic
2010-03-29T14:49:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	yes
2010-03-29T14:49:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	searched DKMS in synaptic, no result
2010-03-29T14:50:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	https://launchpad.net/dkms << Download from here
2010-03-29T14:52:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	i clearly really screwed up. I got this: tmp/dkms_2.1.0.1.orig.tar.gz could not be opened, because the associated helper application does not exist. Change the association in your preferences.
2010-03-29T14:52:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	I lost important applications
2010-03-29T14:54:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Wait, I'll tell you the name of that app
2010-03-29T14:54:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	thanks. I feel like I am wasting your time
2010-03-29T14:56:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	You are not wasting my time :) don't worry about it; install app-install-data-partner and app-install-data
2010-03-29T14:57:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	it says both are already newest version
2010-03-29T14:58:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	figured it out
2010-03-29T14:58:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	i untarred and then did sudo make install
2010-03-29T14:59:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	dkms is now a working command again
2010-03-29T14:59:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	perfect :)
2010-03-29T14:59:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	we are back to first square though, dkms still making same error
2010-03-29T15:01:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	I'll keep and eye to my synaptic, and I'll see if I have any dependence of that
2010-03-29T15:01:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	ok thanks!
2010-03-29T15:02:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
2010-03-29T15:02:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
2010-03-29T15:03:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	You need to have this packages: module-init-tolls gcc make build-essentian and dpkg.dev
2010-03-29T15:03:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	what do i need?
2010-03-29T15:03:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	I haven't read sorry, bot quieted you due to flood; paste in pastebin please
2010-03-29T15:03:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	or should i say, how do i get that
2010-03-29T15:04:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	sorry about that. here is pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu.com/405922/
2010-03-29T15:06:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	It seems you are using old/new repositories, and that packages aren't avaiable
2010-03-29T15:08:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	so i need to upgrade my repo list?
2010-03-29T15:09:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	I think yes; go to software sources, and in first tab, enable all options; except last one (code), that's unnecesary
2010-03-29T15:09:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	If it doesn't work, you'll need surelly other repos
2010-03-29T15:10:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	where do i do this?
2010-03-29T15:10:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	And I recommend you using "main server"
2010-03-29T15:10:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	System >> Administration >> Software sources >> Ubuntu software
2010-03-29T15:11:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	did that, none were checked, all checked now. now what?
2010-03-29T15:11:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	dpkg-dev installing!
2010-03-29T15:12:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Cool, that was problem, you'll needed enabling that :)
2010-03-29T15:13:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	ok! did that, but error is still the same
2010-03-29T15:13:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Try installing build-essentials and check if it works
2010-03-29T15:14:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	noting upgraded when i did sudo apt-get install build-essentials
2010-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Install from synaptic >> dpkg perl5
2010-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	and perl-modules
2010-03-29T15:15:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	dpkg perl5 doesn't exist
2010-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Depends: perl5
2010-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Well, you need it, maybe from other repo or from official web? or launchpad or getdeb
2010-03-29T15:16:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	quick search of perl5 reveals no package with that name
2010-03-29T15:19:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	installed perl
2010-03-29T15:20:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	still getting the DKMS error
2010-03-29T15:20:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	this is driving crazy!
2010-03-29T15:20:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	pfff, I haven't got any idea :S
2010-03-29T15:21:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	the error is Error! Could not locate rt73.ko for module rt73-k2wrlz in the DKMS tree.You must run a dkms build for kernel 2.6.31-14-generic (i686) first.
2010-03-29T15:22:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	I'm sorry, but I don't know how to fix it :(
2010-03-29T15:22:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	no problem, thank you so very much, you have been very helpful :)
2010-03-29T15:22:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	What's you main language?

2010-03-29T15:23:00.000Z	overmind	DigitalOSH	Maybe try in #ubuntu-nl :)
2010-03-29T15:23:00.000Z	DigitalOSH	overmind	i will try. thank you ver much again
