2009-11-27T01:14:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	type in:  sudo fdisk -l
2009-11-27T01:14:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	are you able to put what it outputs into http://paste.ubuntu.com ?
2009-11-27T01:14:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	nothing showed
2009-11-27T01:16:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	you mean it looks like this? http://paste.ubuntu.com/328768/plain/
2009-11-27T01:16:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	in your terminal when you run it.
2009-11-27T01:16:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	correct
2009-11-27T01:17:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	ok, reboot into BIOS configuration.
2009-11-27T01:17:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	u know what i did, i plugged in my usb to the port and gparted showed me the disk
2009-11-27T01:18:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	want me to reboot?
2009-11-27T01:18:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	reboot into BIOS config, yes. It looks like your internal drive is not detected.
2009-11-27T01:19:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	is either no power, dead, or disconnected.
2009-11-27T01:20:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	its seems like it cause when i plug in usb external it showed me in gparted the usb disk
2009-11-27T01:20:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	from bios where should i go
2009-11-27T01:21:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	does the main screen not tell you what hard drives are detected?
2009-11-27T01:22:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	 its not showing disk just mmodel product system board Id service processor processor speed total memory bios version serial number UUID i system factored installed
2009-11-27T01:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	and flicking through the menus shows no sign of a hard drive?
2009-11-27T01:24:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	 when i click it it shows No IDE device
2009-11-27T01:24:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	hmm ... so the internal hard drive is either dead, no power or disconnected.
2009-11-27T01:24:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	but the disk worked b4 i took it out and I took all the pictures etc
2009-11-27T01:25:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	power means that the motherboard doesnt give enough power to support the hd i think so
2009-11-27T01:25:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	it may be better for an engineer to have a look at it - or someone who is comfortable with opening/checking that hard drive cables are in correct.
2009-11-27T01:26:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	and in the last resort - swapping the hard drive for another.
2009-11-27T01:26:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	i will figure something out thnx for ur help bud
2009-11-27T01:37:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	is there a way cause i took out the hd and plug in as usb can i installl system on usb?
2009-11-27T01:37:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	i think the motherboard doesnt give enough power for the hd
2009-11-27T01:40:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	not very likely.
2009-11-27T01:43:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	i see the disk its workin on live cd
2009-11-27T01:43:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	hmm?
2009-11-27T01:43:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	the disk showed in gparted
2009-11-27T01:44:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	no way to install the OS on it
2009-11-27T01:44:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	?
2009-11-27T01:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	the disk is shown in gparted?
2009-11-27T01:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	what size?
2009-11-27T01:45:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	yessir
2009-11-27T01:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	okies, not sure what you did, but looks like it is all good for now.
2009-11-27T01:46:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	do what you want with it, I suppose.
2009-11-27T01:47:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	its workin as it was usb the disk i have cables and i plug in the disk to the cables and to the usb
2009-11-27T01:48:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	is there a way to boot it from usb hd?
2009-11-27T01:49:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	yes, when your system initial POST screen shows, you should be allowed to press a button to go to the SBIOS Boot Menu
2009-11-27T01:49:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	i am installin the ubuntu on it
2009-11-27T01:50:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	sbios menu?
2009-11-27T01:53:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	system bios boot menu.
2009-11-27T01:53:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	it's just a list of bootable devices.
2009-11-27T01:53:00.000Z	mzawieska	ibuclaw	where is that exactly
2009-11-27T01:53:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	when the INITIAL screen loads, it should tell you to press a button to go to the boot menu.
2009-11-27T01:54:00.000Z	ibuclaw	mzawieska	if you want to boot off an external drive, that is.
