2012-01-19T18:04:00.000Z	llsam		hello
2012-01-19T18:05:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	what are you trying to do?
2012-01-19T18:08:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	why are you trying to remove the hidden directories under your home folder?
2012-01-19T18:11:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	im am tring to recover my messed gdm
2012-01-19T18:26:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	why didn't you back them up before removing?
2012-01-19T18:26:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	becouse i was stupid and didnt think on my own
2012-01-19T18:28:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	we all learn from our own mistakes :)
2012-01-19T18:29:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	at least now you won't likely repeat that mistake
2012-01-19T18:30:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	never..but i feel realy lamed now..i am not a geek...normal user without much hackintg experience
2012-01-19T18:32:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	ist there any possibility to recover this data?
2012-01-19T18:33:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	in other words, it might be possible but not likely (or easy)
2012-01-19T18:33:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i must try it
2012-01-19T18:33:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	better i dont reboot now
2012-01-19T18:36:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i alway keep my important stuff on another partition and back it up on an external harddrive
2012-01-19T18:36:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	my /home/is on external partition
2012-01-19T18:37:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i don't keep my important data on /home/
2012-01-19T18:38:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	...
2012-01-19T18:38:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	it is good practice to keep important data seperate from the OS
2012-01-19T18:38:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	how i said...i had never problems like this
2012-01-19T18:39:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	now you see why it is good practice (not nice to learn the hard way though)
2012-01-19T18:42:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i look on the documantation but i dont see there any possibility to recover explicite folders...just all partitions. I m affraid to do that
2012-01-19T18:42:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i came here for help
2012-01-19T18:43:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i thought it is a support channel
2012-01-19T18:43:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i can only help you with what i know
2012-01-19T18:43:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	s√≥metimes is very hard to hear that the really big supporter making advice to the people as they should lknow everything..
2012-01-19T18:44:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i've never had to restore my data, but i have given you advise on why it is important to have backups
2012-01-19T18:44:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	thank you
2012-01-19T18:45:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	sorry i can't help you recover the data, my experience in that area is very limited
2012-01-19T18:45:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	okay, thank you anyway very much
2012-01-19T19:00:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	when you say start gdm are you referring to the login manager?
2012-01-19T19:00:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	yes i do
2012-01-19T19:00:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	the login manager should start on its own
2012-01-19T19:01:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2012-01-19T19:01:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	it is starting but looks differrent and also gdm power manager complains
2012-01-19T19:01:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	10.04 64bit
2012-01-19T19:01:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	there is no such thing as gdm power manager
2012-01-19T19:01:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	gdm is the gnome display manager
2012-01-19T19:01:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	some power manager or something
2012-01-19T19:03:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	so gdm (the login screen) loads fine and you can enter your username and password?
2012-01-19T19:03:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	yes...but it looks crappy ..i can choose there users but no other options available as normal
2012-01-19T19:04:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	what happens when you login?
2012-01-19T19:05:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	it gives error...something with sanity-check of gconf
2012-01-19T19:05:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	sorry i cant say now exactly#
2012-01-19T19:06:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	and that is with the newly created user?
2012-01-19T19:06:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	yes also with the new created user
2012-01-19T19:06:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	hmm, something is very broken
2012-01-19T19:07:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	when did you first have this problem
2012-01-19T19:07:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	yes. my disk?
2012-01-19T19:08:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	it apears yesterday during some installation of eclipse plugins...i lost suddenly permissions. i have reboot and saw sanity-check errors
2012-01-19T19:08:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i discover also another problems with mktemp
2012-01-19T19:09:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	where did you get the eclipse plugins from? did you install eclipse from the repo?
2012-01-19T19:09:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	no, i have removed ecliupse from the repos and took brand fresh indigo version from the eclipse site
2012-01-19T19:10:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	ah, that means we can't support you with eclipse
2012-01-19T19:10:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	becouse i have problems with installing subcliupse plugin, some developer told me this is becouse the old ubuntu repe bvuild
2012-01-19T19:10:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	how old is your harddrive?
2012-01-19T19:11:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	eclipse is not the problem right now...i can leave without eclipse
2012-01-19T19:11:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	let me think..some 3 years...it is sata
2012-01-19T19:12:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	hmm, my guess is that eclipse is to blame
2012-01-19T19:12:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	what are you suggesting? to go and by new hd and install fresh system?
2012-01-19T19:13:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	shit..thats bad
2012-01-19T19:13:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i'm not sure how you installed it, but i'd reccomend removing it
2012-01-19T19:13:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	how can be possible that eclipse messed so badly system?=
2012-01-19T19:14:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i don't know, but if this problen occurred directly after installing the plugins, something changed somewhere that broke something
2012-01-19T19:14:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	sorry for my language! thats becouse im so destroyed now :)
2012-01-19T19:16:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	things like this is why i only stick to what is in the official repos
2012-01-19T19:17:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i will go now to by a new disk, and i will try to install new system. could you tell me if this brand new ubuntu is good and stable enough for my all hard core grafix stuff?
2012-01-19T19:17:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	11.10 works fine for me
2012-01-19T19:18:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	not sure why you want to get a new harddrive
2012-01-19T19:18:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i will need to install blender cycles render machine, with newwest nvidia driver, opensim server with mono, eclipse indigo and lot of other tools
2012-01-19T19:19:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	do you use a lot of ppas?
2012-01-19T19:20:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	yes...
2012-01-19T19:20:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i see :)
2012-01-19T19:20:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	ppas are unsupported
2012-01-19T19:20:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	but no worry...i was always looking for conflicts
2012-01-19T19:21:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	but my work is so that i need tools which are not in repos
2012-01-19T19:21:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	the more ppas you use the more likely something might break
2012-01-19T19:21:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i know that problem. but i must go on, that is my bread..:)
2012-01-19T19:22:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	no wonder you have loads of problems, i never use ppas and i've never had any problems
2012-01-19T19:22:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	look, becouse i cant solvve my problem now, and anyway my disk ist almost full, i rthink it is a goof ideea to buy new one and install new system
2012-01-19T19:24:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i don't often say this but i think perhaps you would want to try a different distribution which supports the software you need
2012-01-19T19:24:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	or maybe you have anothere ideea ? i am very open
2012-01-19T19:24:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i do not know windows system  and im only using open source
2012-01-19T19:25:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i didn't suggest windows
2012-01-19T19:26:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	maybe thoise archlinux would better support my intrest?
2012-01-19T19:26:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	i use arch and its very good, but this is getting a little offtopic for ubuntu support
2012-01-19T19:27:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i understand..puh...
2012-01-19T19:27:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	feel free to pmme if you want to talk about other distros
2012-01-19T19:28:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	i will come back... i go to to buy a new disk. suddenly i am very decided to do that as a right
2012-01-19T19:28:00.000Z	llsam	auronandace	thank you very very much for your friendly help
2012-01-19T19:29:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	no worries :)
2012-01-19T21:51:00.000Z	auronandace	llsam	hi
