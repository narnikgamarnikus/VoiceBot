2006-12-05T13:31:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	it did nothing
2006-12-05T13:26:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	if you can see it in the computer view, it normally means that it is already mounted
2006-12-05T13:27:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	check with 'mount' in a terminal.
2006-12-05T13:27:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	yeah, but I can't read or write to it
2006-12-05T13:27:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	how do i do that
2006-12-05T13:27:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	open a terminal (Alt-F2, enter 'gnome-terminal') and run 'mount'
2006-12-05T13:28:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	look at the output and see if you can make sense of it
2006-12-05T13:28:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	how is it connected? IDE? SATA? Channel of its own? Slave drive?
2006-12-05T13:29:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	it's an ide drive of it's won
2006-12-05T13:30:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	it should appear as /dev/hdcX then, with X probably =1
2006-12-05T13:30:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	try 'mount | grep ntfs', that filters the output for the string ntfs
2006-12-05T13:31:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	in that case I was wrong and it isn't mounted.
2006-12-05T13:33:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	how do i  mount it, i tried mount hdb1
2006-12-05T13:34:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	let's first try and identify the device name. Run 'sudo fstab -l' in the terminal. It will ask for your password and then list the hard disk devices.
2006-12-05T13:34:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	it's definitely not hdb, because hdb would denote a slave drive on IDE channel 0.
2006-12-05T13:35:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	command not found
2006-12-05T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	sorry, 'sudo fdisk -l'
2006-12-05T13:36:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	ok
2006-12-05T13:38:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	so it sees it
2006-12-05T13:38:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	so what's the device name of your 322 GB partition?
2006-12-05T13:39:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	lemme guess,
2006-12-05T13:39:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	mount hda
2006-12-05T13:39:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	poor guess
2006-12-05T13:40:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	 i see
2006-12-05T13:40:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	well, I tried
2006-12-05T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	look through the fdisk -l output.
2006-12-05T13:41:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	and i'm looking for....
2006-12-05T13:41:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	hda1?
2006-12-05T13:41:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	a section with a plausible disk size and an NTFS partition
2006-12-05T13:42:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	i see it
2006-12-05T13:42:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	wait
2006-12-05T13:43:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	by plausible you mean: the 200+gig one, right?
2006-12-05T13:43:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	yes, if that's your only drive of that size
2006-12-05T13:44:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	and then what?
2006-12-05T13:45:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	I need you to tell me the device name. Something like /dev/hdxY with x one of a b c d... and Y a number
2006-12-05T13:47:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	Disk /dev/hda: 251.0 GB, 251000193024 bytes
2006-12-05T13:47:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	you need the device name of the NTFS partition
2006-12-05T13:48:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	/dev/hda1   *           1       32422   245110288+   7  HPFS/NTFS
2006-12-05T13:49:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	what do you get when you 'sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt'?
2006-12-05T13:50:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	well, I didn't know you were supposed to put /mnt after it
2006-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	it's just one possibility. If you use /mnt your drive contents will appear inside the directory /mnt/
2006-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	 it worked!
2006-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	only
2006-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	you can't write to NTFS
2006-12-05T13:51:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	i dont' have the permissinons necessary
2006-12-05T13:52:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	to see the contents
2006-12-05T13:52:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	this is a good time to read the documentation that ubotu will point you to:
2006-12-05T13:52:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	thanks
2006-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	what should I do? As of Ubuntu 6.04 (Dapper Drake) there is slightly more NTFS writing support
2006-12-05T13:57:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	I can't take that decision off you, but my inclination would be to risk it.
2006-12-05T13:58:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	first of all, if you have a backup, there's a way to recover.
2006-12-05T13:58:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	and if not?
2006-12-05T13:58:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	i'm up the creek with no canoe?
2006-12-05T13:59:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	second, the features of NTFS that are used as standard are most likely well considered in the driver. It's when you use unusual NTFS features that your filesystem is at risk.
2006-12-05T13:59:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	data you haven't backed up is data you don't want ;)
2006-12-05T14:00:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	I think this is a quote from tonyyarusso
2006-12-05T14:01:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	if I make a partition on the 200 gig drive, (ntfs) seperate from the main windows one, and have all data that I want shared there availible to both OSs, is that a good idea?
2006-12-05T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	yes
2006-12-05T14:02:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	especially since you can create a non-NTFS filesystem - I'd recommend ext3 although you will have to install a driver in Windows to read/write to it.
2006-12-05T14:03:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	is it a free driver?
2006-12-05T14:03:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	yes, of course -- ext3 is GPL
2006-12-05T14:06:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	it is showing that the drive is empty
2006-12-05T14:07:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	how did you check that?
2006-12-05T14:08:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	places>computer
2006-12-05T14:09:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	select Go-Location and type /mnt/
2006-12-05T14:09:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	what is golocation?/
2006-12-05T14:09:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	search?
2006-12-05T14:10:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	a menu command in nautilus
2006-12-05T14:10:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	nautulis?
2006-12-05T14:10:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	nautilus is the program that opens when you select Places-Computer
2006-12-05T14:10:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	probably says 'File Browser' in the title bar
2006-12-05T14:11:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	am I supposed to see something?
2006-12-05T14:12:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	if your drive is still mounted, yes
2006-12-05T14:13:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	so if i'm not seeing anything, that's bad?
2006-12-05T14:13:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	probably not -- maybe you've unmounted the drive in the meantime
2006-12-05T14:13:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	hmmmm.... that sounds serious
2006-12-05T14:14:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	why, what have you done?
2006-12-05T14:14:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	nothing
2006-12-05T14:15:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	back in the terminal, run 'mount' and see if your NTFS partition is mounted on /mnt (or somewhere else)
2006-12-05T14:16:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	well, it shows the correct ammount of free space, but still no files
2006-12-05T14:17:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	but you saw files there before, didn't you?
2006-12-05T14:19:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	it's very unlikely that you have changed any data on that partition accidentally, so I wouldn't worry, but check that you can still boot Windows from that drive.
2006-12-05T14:19:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	are you using NTFS compression?
2006-12-05T14:21:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	i'll check windows now, Thanks so muck for your help!
2006-12-05T14:56:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	are you still there?
2006-12-05T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	yes, but not for long ;)
2006-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	it worked!
2006-12-05T14:57:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	well done
2006-12-05T14:58:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	if i make a new partition, will it be labeled as hda2?
2006-12-05T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	if you make a primary one, yes.
2006-12-05T14:59:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	I can have multiple primary partitions on one drive
2008-03-27T04:43:00.000Z	soundray	kevin_	fortune?
2008-03-27T04:43:00.000Z	kevin_	soundray	Thank you.
