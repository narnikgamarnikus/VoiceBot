2005-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	we don't want to be wind0ze
2005-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	true... but the idea seems (if you want to attract the non-technically included) to become more and more like it
2005-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	wind0ze is not that to which we aspire
2005-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	3d has never worked right on my lapotp... and the hardware acceleration drivers are just coming up to speed years after the hardware was released :)
2005-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	not a perfect linux world i live in :)
2005-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	We aspire to useable, friendly, free software
2005-02-16T11:43:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	huh?
2005-02-16T11:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	exactly, and that is what frustrates me -- it creates the impression that we aspire to windows, which is what first caught my eye about your comments ;-)
2005-02-16T11:44:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	it just saddens me to see people who don't know anything about linux asking basic questions... because the goal (evidentally) is to make it open to less and less technically skilled, but it's not ready on all hardware
2005-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	then change it
2005-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	who's praising windows?
2005-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	we're trying, but here you are praising it ;-)
2005-02-16T11:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i just know a LOT of my hardware works flawlessly on windows and still doesn't work on linux
2005-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	flawlessly?  Including the viruses, spyware, and inflated cost?
2005-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	give me a break, you must be trolling
2005-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	a lot of that is user education (except for IE)
2005-02-16T11:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i ran windows (with firefox) and never had any of those problems
2005-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i'm not trolling :) I have a thinkpad, and accelerated video is flakey (but improving every day) sound doesn't survive suspend/resume, no dual-head, etc
2005-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	you're 'dreaming' frankly -- read the experiences of others -- it is a horrible, defenceless OS, completely under attack by crippling malware
2005-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	windows works much better when run by technically included...
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i know a few sys admins who never have those types of problems but i fix windows pcs all the time from regular joes that do
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	if yer not connected to the Net, I'm sure wind0ze behaves just fine :P
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i think windows is mostly superior in hardware support
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	if i could have all the hardware drivers on linux that'd seal the deal for me
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	but some corps need office, and other windows apps
2005-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	there are so many problems with windows, that frankly I cannot take you seriously any longer.  Let's concentrate on creating an alternative to that mess, shall we?
2005-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	sure, i run linux :)  but our customers use windows :)
2005-02-16T11:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	anyway, this is a Ubuntu support channel, right?  Why are you on about wind0ze here anyway?
2005-02-17T14:14:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	you still not like me?
2005-02-17T14:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	I changed my mind - yer a fuckin retard
2005-02-17T14:15:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	we were talking about pngs
2005-02-17T14:15:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	and that cussing was entirely unecessary
2005-02-17T14:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	no you were selling us IE
2005-02-17T14:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	good
2005-02-17T14:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	shouldn't even be here AFAICT
2005-02-17T14:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	go away
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	sure it does :)
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	suuuure
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	it was just mentioned earlier
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	you're on crack dude
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i ran IE 6 on Gentoo for a year
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	why in fucks name would you want to, for one thing
2005-02-17T14:24:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	for developing websites
2005-02-17T14:27:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	Microsoft Office runs on Linux too, ya know? ;-)
2005-02-17T14:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	M$ sucks
2005-02-17T14:27:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	for once i agree with you :)
2005-02-17T14:28:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	are you 13?
2005-02-17T14:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	go away - what are you even doing in this channel?
2005-02-17T14:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	go away
2005-02-17T14:28:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i like the company, excluding one :)
2005-02-17T14:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	I'd recommend you die (what *are* you doing here anyway?)
2005-02-17T14:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i'm a linux user and soon to be ubuntu user :)
2005-02-17T14:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	we're just tring to decided where all that pent up anger comes from :)
2005-02-17T14:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	you need to get with the program, and stop cheerleading for M$
2005-02-17T14:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	lol
2005-02-17T14:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i'm not :)
2005-02-17T14:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	you insult me with yer stupidity - that's where my anger comes from
2005-02-17T14:33:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	well, you should get a grip on it or go to some anger management :)
2005-02-17T14:33:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	if stupid people make you anger one day you'll be in jail :) the world is full of stupider people than I :)
2005-02-17T14:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	die
2005-02-17T14:34:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	how old are you?
2005-02-17T14:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	none of yer fuckin business, dickhead
2005-02-17T14:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	and I think you are a fucking idiot :P
2005-02-17T14:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	you're not ignored for the evening :) have a great windows free life :)
2005-02-17T14:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	this *is* Ubuntu (not wind0ze), no?
2005-02-17T14:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	download the latest wind0ze security update ;-)
2005-02-21T17:33:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	?
2005-02-21T17:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	^-l  ?
2005-02-21T17:33:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	what's that?
2005-02-21T17:33:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i'm not sure why you mention it, give me more context
2005-02-21T17:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	should 'redraw' the screen (if I understand your Q correctly)
2005-02-21T17:34:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	no, you missed it
2005-02-21T17:34:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	after resizing a window irssi would always be messed up...  i used to only need to disconnect and reconnect screen to fix it.. (with sarge)... now that does not work with ubuntu
2005-02-21T17:34:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	and it doesn't make _any_ sense to me
2005-02-21T17:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	define "messed up" then :-)
2005-02-21T17:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	it would draw things in the wrong places all the time
2005-02-21T17:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	try Ctrl-l and see if that helps; if not, I have no other suggestions that come to mind ATM
2005-02-21T17:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	but disconnecting and reconecting screen _always_ fixed it... and with ubuntu this doesn't work (despite the fact that the software in question is on the server)
2005-02-21T17:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	no, ctrl-l doesn't know the new size of the window
2005-02-21T17:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	/resize works, but it's annoying to have an extra step since i move and resize windows a lot
2005-02-21T17:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	you've already tried that then?
2005-02-21T17:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i'll live with it, but just one annoyance that's still bugging me
2005-02-21T17:37:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	next time i'm in debian i'll confirm that the behavior is correct there, but i only tend to notice things when they are different :)
2005-02-21T17:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	hrm, it's an odd sounding problem; not sure what to suggest frankly
2005-02-21T17:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	might want to try screen in a different terminal and see what happens, now that I think of it
2005-02-21T17:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	tried it with xterminal and xterm, same issues
2005-02-21T17:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	curiouser and curiouser
2005-02-21T17:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	well, next i need to confirm it still works in debian... and if so... what does that leave? bash? env variables?
2005-02-21T17:41:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i suppose ssh might negotiate the connection differently or something?
2005-02-21T17:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	it's hard to know.  I've had problems with display (for example with Gnome-terminal) and switching to rxvt worked for me, so <shrug>
2005-02-21T17:42:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Xenguy	i think it's deeper than that though... gnome-terminal is what i used under debian too :)
2005-02-21T17:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	nod
2005-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	Dreamer3	this channel is usually quite active
