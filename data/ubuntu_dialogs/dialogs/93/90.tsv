2005-09-24T15:30:00.000Z	Da_SWAT		how do I start the device manager from console?
2005-09-24T15:32:00.000Z	Da_SWAT		thnx :)
2005-09-24T15:33:00.000Z	Da_SWAT		Does anyone in here own a DVD drive from Pioneer? (I have a DVR-108) It's not recognized (special device not found @ boot) at all. Any pointers?
2005-09-24T15:34:00.000Z	Da_SWAT		[LethAL] , yes
2005-09-24T15:35:00.000Z	Da_SWAT		I've even started a topic on this |---> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=34516&page=3
2005-09-24T15:36:00.000Z	Da_SWAT		I'm just hoping that it will be resolved in the breezy release, but I won't bet my money on it. It just sucks that I MUST boot to Windows to burn anything here
2005-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	are u running Hoary at the moment?
2005-09-24T15:37:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	yes
2005-09-24T15:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	have you got a CD that we could play with and maybe turn into a coaster if it does not work?
2005-09-24T15:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	(doh) does work?
2005-09-24T15:40:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	if your interested please paste the contents of /etc/fstab into paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-24T15:40:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	then I will guess if I can do anything or not
2005-09-24T15:42:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2342
2005-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	so where is the hard drive?
2005-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I took those parts out, because they work just fine.
2005-09-24T15:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	 that we could burn to
2005-09-24T15:45:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	especially for you    http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2343
2005-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	tell me have you got a disk there we can use to test my brilliant theorys (at least thats what they will be if this works)
2005-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I have a lot of empty cd's here, so I have stuff to burn. But first ubuntu needs to recognize the drive
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	but first nothing - have you an iso you want worked with - not audio as iso
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	an iso
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	or will we make one for testing
2005-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I think I have one hanging around
2005-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	lets make one
2005-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	it is easy
2005-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	ROFL. Found a ISO (UBCD) So I'm good to go
2005-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	have you got any files on your desktop?
2005-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	yeah
2005-09-24T15:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	okay, start a terminal & do this >> tar  cvf desk.tar Desktop/
2005-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	done (sorry for the delay)
2005-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	ls -alh desk.tar show a size greater than the size of a CD ?
2005-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	no
2005-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	good we may proceed do this in your terminal >> mkisofs -o my.iso desk.tar
2005-09-24T16:03:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	done
2005-09-24T16:04:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	just a moment please brb
2005-09-24T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	try this NB the use of hdd could be hdc on your machine so if you have nothing in the other drive it will fail in a second and then you can change the hd* setting >>>  cdrecord -pad -eject dev=/dev/hdd my.iso
2005-09-24T16:11:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I'll try it (yet I'll imediately try it with the hdc because that the 'kaput' drive)
2005-09-24T16:12:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	it didnt' work
2005-09-24T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	sorry change that to dvdrecord
2005-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	what's the difference with cdrecord?
2005-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	and I don't have dvdrecord on my system (or in my universe). I do have k3b
2005-09-24T16:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	try to install dvdbackup
2005-09-24T16:15:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	done
2005-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	the nice thing was in universe :)
2005-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	now try dvdrecord
2005-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	dvdrecord: command not found :P
2005-09-24T16:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	ahh bother1
2005-09-24T16:20:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	what now?
2005-09-24T16:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	is that any use?  >> apt-cache show dvdrtools
2005-09-24T16:23:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	package not found
2005-09-24T16:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	its in multiverse
2005-09-24T16:31:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I'm here. dvdrecord is installed
2005-09-24T16:32:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	dvdrecord. No such file or directory. No read access for 'dev/dev/hdc'.
2005-09-24T16:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	now do dvdrecord (I am off to make a coffee back in a couple of mins)
2005-09-24T16:33:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	dvdrecord. No such file or directory. No read access for 'dev/dev/hdc'.
2005-09-24T16:33:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	and the hdc is the one that isn't recognized
2005-09-24T16:35:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	when will you be back from your coffee break? :D
2005-09-24T16:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	 anytime I feel like it :-) anyway I'm back now
2005-09-24T16:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	did u do that with dvdrecord ?
2005-09-24T16:44:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	yes
2005-09-24T16:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	and
2005-09-24T16:44:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	dvdrecord. No such file or directory. No read access for 'dev/dev/hdc'.
2005-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	come on that was not the command
2005-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	that was the output of the command for dvdrecord
2005-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	this  >>>  dvdrecord -pad -eject dev=/dev/hdd my.iso    <<   note the equals  just in case
2005-09-24T16:47:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	damn, then I did something wrong. Anyway, my hdc device (pioneer) gives an error. Cannot open /dev/hdc. No such file/direcotry
2005-09-24T16:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	so what is confusing the living ** out of me is what is that /dev/hdc entry in your fstab
2005-09-24T16:50:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I think I made that manually once or something. It SHOULD work this way, yet it doesn't. I've tried countless number of things.... none were succesfull
2005-09-24T16:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	have you tried breezy or hoary, or both?
2005-09-24T16:51:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	only hoary. I'll try breezy when it's gold :P
2005-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	zcat[1]  that has physical implications - that needs to be taken to #offtopic :)
2005-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	the thing that is scaring me is that my drive works perfectly under winblows :(
2005-09-24T16:55:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	does not scare me
2005-09-24T16:55:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	LOL
2005-09-24T16:55:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	what does ls -l /dev/hdc tell you?
2005-09-24T16:55:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	no such file or directory
2005-09-24T16:56:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	that might have lot to do with your problems
2005-09-24T16:57:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	you mean the fact that my drive isn't recognized by Ubuntu? (what I have been saying all along)
2005-09-24T05:08:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	what you would recommend I do now?
2005-09-24T05:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	try a live CD of breezy badger to see if it can see the CD
2005-09-24T05:12:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	well, thanks for your time and help. I'll try the live CD and hope for better days
2005-09-24T05:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	just check that both drives are set to master and slave and not cs
2005-09-24T05:14:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	done... twice or thrice or something
2005-09-24T05:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	one of the drives is faulty - is it faulty under windows also?
2005-09-24T05:16:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	nope. I burn my DVD's (winblows) with the faulty drive (ubuntu)
2005-09-24T05:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	are both working in windows was my question
2005-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	sorry bad way of phrasing it
2005-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	yes. In windows everything works fine :)
2005-09-24T10:15:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	for the record, Ubuntu breezy just recognized my DVD burner :D
2005-09-24T10:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	great, emmmm so are you going to do the brave thing and upgrade - or wait for release :)
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I'm playing safe. I've been waiting for months (since the last release) so I can wait a few days more. Do you know the exact ETA?
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Da_SWAT	well the rumour mill says the 13th of October
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	Da_SWAT	ompaul	I hope so. Then I can show breezy off at my LAN :D
