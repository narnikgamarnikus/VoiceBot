2011-04-30T03:02:00.000Z	rgr		its not obsolete at all
2011-04-30T03:03:00.000Z	rgr		obsix : there are loads of bugs.
2011-04-30T03:03:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	i'm confident you're filing them instead of just complaining about them
2011-04-30T03:04:00.000Z	rgr	ohsix	You would be correct on the former. Stop misleading people. There are oodles of cases where an xorf.conf is required. It is not true to say its obsolete.
2011-04-30T03:04:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	the bugs are cases where people need to do workarounds, the default should work
2011-04-30T03:04:00.000Z	rgr	ohsix	this is simply not true.
2011-04-30T03:04:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you need one, you are doing something wrong, full stop
2011-04-30T03:04:00.000Z	rgr	ohsix	 then you dont know what youre talking about.
2011-04-30T03:05:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	i do, sorry to break it to you
2011-04-30T03:05:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you'll notice that the manual pages for the xorg drivers are still there so you can add workarounds in exceptional situations
2011-04-30T03:05:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you say "many", but it's just nvidia's proprietary driver re: xrandr
2011-04-30T03:06:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	that is an exceptional case with the proprietary nvidia driver, and that's nvidias problem, complain to them
2011-04-30T03:06:00.000Z	rgr	ohsix	it is the users problem.
2011-04-30T03:06:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	that's great, you know nvidia's driver is awful; good on you
2011-04-30T03:06:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	users have nouveau and xrandr
2011-04-30T03:07:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you're on a moral crusade my friend
2011-04-30T03:08:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	nvidia is garbage because it doesn't do xrandr 1.2+
2011-04-30T03:08:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	but one is free and can be improved
2011-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	in many EXCEPTIONAL cases, you may need one
2011-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	but you don't want one if you aren't in an exceptional situation, it's highly higly contraindicated
2011-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you're literally talking about an xorg.conf being loaded and read, you're right; it still does that
2011-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	i thought you were just talking about being on a help channel
2011-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you have information you want to provide, provide it; google provides results almost unique to each user, it will find different things than a google search you run will
2011-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you're not helping people it's probably not best to send them off in random directions either
2011-04-30T04:50:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	#ubuntu-offtopic for opinions
2011-04-30T04:50:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	also unsubstantiated assertions don't help anyone
2011-04-30T04:50:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	it sounds like you don't really want to be here to help people
2011-04-30T04:51:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you need to enable remote access
2011-04-30T04:51:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	ubuntu uses ufw/
2011-04-30T04:53:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	save your opinions
2011-04-30T04:53:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you want to debate it, #ubuntu-desktop
2011-04-30T04:56:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	url to said wiki?
2011-04-30T04:56:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	trial and error is garbage
2011-04-30T04:57:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	namely because nobody knows what "error" is, so when they find something that works they've found a nonsolution or work around
2011-04-30T04:58:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	i'll ask again if you aren't going to help people to please not speak at all; there are a lot of people looking for help
2011-04-30T22:39:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	don't tell people to google
2011-04-30T22:39:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you are not going to personally instruct them, then don't offer any advice
2011-04-30T22:40:00.000Z	rgr	ohsix	we discussed you butting in yesterday when you were incorrect about xorg.conf.
2011-04-30T22:40:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you have an exceptional case and you don't except that, i said that if you mean that it is still read if it is present you are correct
2011-04-30T22:40:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	but it is highly deprecated and you should never have to edit it, in your case you have to; that's a shame
2011-04-30T22:41:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you should talk to your gpu driver vendor
2011-04-30T22:42:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	google returns different results for different people, if you have something in mind for them to read; google yourself and provide it directly, they will not find it no matter how specific the query
2011-04-30T23:24:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	wonder somewhere else.
2011-04-30T23:29:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	this communication doesn't take place over dbus, so before you call someone silly know what you're talking about
2011-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	my intel card is great
2011-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	did you have an i810? refrain from offering "advice" like that please
2011-04-30T23:37:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	please don't suggest people try sgfxi, it will likely just make a mess someoen else will have to clean up
2011-04-30T23:40:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	please, refrain from speaking at all if you aren't going to be helping people
2011-04-30T23:43:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	apt-cache search is generally more comprehensible without introducing all the complexity of something like synaptic
2011-04-30T23:44:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you referred him to search with something else
2011-04-30T23:45:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	think about telling a frail old lady to use a computer when all she wanted was a calculator
2011-04-30T23:45:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if she already knows about computers it's a bonus, otherwise it is needless trouble
2011-04-30T23:46:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	synaptic may seem simple to you, and you even know it can search! but if telling someone to run a command that directly shows the information they are interested, and is comprehensible, it is preferable
2011-04-30T23:52:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	the xorg.conf is not there unless you have a proprietary driver (practically speaking, just nvidia) or a custom configuration, on a default install there is no xorg.conf and it's all hot detected
2011-04-30T23:55:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	don't conflate your experience with "grub" "updating" hosing systems, people upgrading and doing things hose systems, if grub or the upgrade process actually did it, it is a bug, and i hope you reported it
2011-04-30T23:56:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	don't tell people to use sgfxi, other people will have to undo the damage it does to fix their problems
2011-04-30T23:58:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	the point of an upgrade is for them to be the same thing in the end, so what you just said is antithetical to the entire process
2011-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	quantify "clean"
2011-05-01T00:02:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	it is extracted and prepared if apt-get source is used
2011-05-01T00:05:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you're getting on peoples last nerve with giving people google links
2011-05-01T00:05:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you have a link in those google results that you intend to give to a person, give them the link
2011-05-01T00:05:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you have a link in those google results that you intend to give to a person, give them the link
2011-05-01T00:07:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	#ubuntu-offtopic
2011-05-01T00:30:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if people are asking they generally don't know what they've changed, or they would have undone it then redone it to confirm their suspicions
2011-05-01T00:34:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	then practically speaking you have said nothing
2011-05-01T00:34:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	this is a help channel
2011-05-01T00:37:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	recommended by who? recommended packages are installed by default
2011-05-01T00:38:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	if you need to provide someone with a specific page in a google result, provide the page; even if it is the top or only result for you, it will not be for other people
2011-05-01T00:39:00.000Z	rgr	ohsix	is also the man who claimed that xorg.conf is obsolete.
2011-05-01T00:39:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	it is no claim, it's for exceptions and you should never want for or have to change it, if you do, it's a bug
2011-05-01T00:40:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	that isn't what i said, i'm sorry we have different definitions of supported
2011-05-01T00:52:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	in your opinion, be clear
2011-05-01T01:10:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	do not suggest people use sgfxi, _someone_ has to clean up the mess afterwards, if that someone is you, tell them in private, but not here
2011-05-01T01:52:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	again, #ubuntu-offtopic, if you have anything to say; lets make it something to help people, that's the entire idea of this channel
2011-05-01T01:58:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	even when you have the potential to answer ... D:
2011-05-01T02:06:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	who are you speaking to?
2011-05-01T02:09:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you need to keep your opinions to yourself, this is a HELP CHANNEL
2011-05-01T02:10:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	ufw has simple allow/deny rules and hooks for more complicated rules that wont be clobbered by user changes
2011-05-01T02:10:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	you could argue that average people shouldn't be setting up more than allow/deny rules anyways; and neither should software packages
2011-05-01T02:11:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	"that good" is your opinion, it is not notable here
2011-05-01T02:14:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	that's great, ubuntu uses ufw; thanks
2011-05-01T02:20:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	address the person you're talking to please, there's a lot of people talking
2011-05-01T02:32:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	#ubuntu-offtopic
2011-05-01T02:32:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	ufw is also a firewall, gufw is a gui for it, read about ufw if you want to know why
2011-05-01T02:37:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	#ubuntu-offtopic
2011-05-01T02:38:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	those don't have anything to do with the session manager
2011-05-01T02:40:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	i wish you'd hold your tongue, you lead people off into the weeds & other people have to bring them back, you're deliberately creating work for other people with more interest in helping than yourself
2011-05-01T02:45:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	keep your opinions to yourself
2011-05-01T02:50:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	people can't usually infer who you're talking to unless you address them, channel often moves past what you're replying to pretty fast too
2011-05-01T03:14:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	address who you are talking to
2011-05-01T03:14:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	please
2011-05-01T03:16:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	it's still in the repositories, if you don't have anything to add please stop
2011-05-01T03:20:00.000Z	ohsix	rgr	apache doens't follow symlinks by default, and you have to setup mod_userdir otherwise
