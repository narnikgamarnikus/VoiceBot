2007-12-31T18:47:00.000Z	rich__		here is my URL http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50258/
2007-12-31T18:49:00.000Z	rich__		its not on there, it isnt mounted
2007-12-31T18:49:00.000Z	rich__		i can created the partition, but when i try to create a FS it says device is in use or busy.
2007-12-31T18:50:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what device are you trying to create a file system on
2007-12-31T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	you've done the paste factoid like 10 times now
2007-12-31T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	if you can't read it by now, you'll never get it
2007-12-31T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what do you actually want
2007-12-31T18:48:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	i want to be able to create a filesystem on my external hard disk, it says that it is busy
2007-12-31T18:48:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	oooh right, which is your external disk on that output
2007-12-31T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what command are you using to make the filesystem, exactly what command
2007-12-31T18:52:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	please show me the otupit of disk -l /dev/sde in a pastebin
2008-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ok - so the device is /dev/sdb
2008-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	usb does work on the kernel
2008-01-04T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	well, thats a different senario
2008-01-04T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what happens when you plug the drive in ?
2008-01-04T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	that's a totally different senario
2008-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	do you get a device file
2008-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	do you have a device file for it when you plug it in
2008-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	which device does it assign to it
2008-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	when you do "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb" do you see a partition table ok
2008-01-04T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	can you please show me the output of "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb"
2008-01-04T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	please put it in a pastebin
2008-01-04T20:18:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50718/
2008-01-04T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	thats sdc - is that the right device ?
2008-01-04T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what file system do you want on it
2008-01-04T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ok so if you did "sudo mke2fs -j /dev/sdc1" what hapens
2008-01-04T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	can you please show me the output of the command "mount" in a pastebin.
2008-01-04T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	fuser /dev/sdc1
2008-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	actually fuser won't work on device files, so sratch that
2008-01-04T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	just give me a moment to ponder that through
2008-01-04T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	I assume lsusb sees it
2008-01-04T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	did you delete a partition before re-creating ?
2008-01-04T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	I have seen a similar yet obscure bug if you did
2008-01-04T20:28:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	yeah i deleted the ntfs ones and then created the linux partition.
2008-01-04T20:32:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	the bug I'm refering to is quite obscure, so it may be nothing
2008-01-04T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	on some usb disks if you delete a partition and then write a partition the new partition is not visable until the disk is rescanned / or a reboot as the partition my show up in fdisk but the writes written to the partition table don't take effect until the disk is re-scanned
2008-01-04T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	it used to happen a lot if you deleted a partition while the file system was mounted
2008-01-04T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	but locks where put in place to stop that, so it's quite rare now
2008-01-04T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	it's because of udev and the usb bus
2008-01-04T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	it's a pretty rare situation
2008-01-04T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	you don't do /dev/sdc
2008-01-04T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	sdc1
2008-01-04T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	also - reboot so you know your disk partition tables have JUST been read, then try
2008-01-04T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	sdc is the disk, sdc1 is the partition
2008-01-04T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	"sudo mke2fs -j /dev/sdc1"
2008-01-04T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ok - so reboot and lets see what happens. Reboot - don't delete, don't sync don't do anything, just reboot and lets check some stuff
2008-01-04T21:04:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	what do you want me to try
2008-01-04T21:04:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ok - so you've just done a reboot, can you please put the following in a pastebin "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc" and "mount" lets check the status of this disk
2008-01-04T21:05:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ok, can you please show the output of mount please so I can see what's where
2008-01-04T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ok, that all looks pretty clear, have you tested making an fs yet ?
2008-01-04T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	I can't see what's locking your device, the only think I can think of is udev
2008-01-04T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	 you could try stopping it, but thats only a random suggestion as I can't think of anything else that would lock it
2008-01-04T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	restarted what ?
2008-01-04T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	try not starting it, just killing it, again it's a long shot, but I can't see what would lock a device file
2008-01-04T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	obscure situation
2008-01-04T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	I use that same disk without any issue
2008-01-04T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	out of interest, have you tried other file systems ?
2008-01-04T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	again, just looking at random stuff here
2008-01-04T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	same as you and older
2008-01-04T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	yup
2008-01-07T17:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	restored to what ?
2008-01-07T17:28:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	i have altered the settings, i want to reconfigure the cards as if i had just power cycled.
2008-01-07T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	change the settings back or reboot
2008-01-07T17:30:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	 do you know?
2008-01-07T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	do I know what ?
2008-01-07T17:32:00.000Z	rich__	ikonia	how to reload the network configuring /etc/networking restart doesnt do anything
2008-01-09T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	thats a debatable question, I say no, I don't rate it, but others find it accaptable
2008-01-09T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	thats a vm issue - not ubuntu
2008-01-10T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	you probably have an eth device defined in your rules
2008-01-10T19:01:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	wired and non-wired = different devices in th eOS
2008-01-10T19:02:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	you don't
2008-01-10T19:02:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	your only hope is to do it by address range rules, which I'm guessing will be the same if yoru wired/not wired
2008-01-10T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	open the terminals and options select the size small/med/large etc
2008-01-10T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	termiunal --> perferences I think
2008-01-10T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	profiles then edit your profile
2008-01-14T22:39:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	do it then
2008-01-14T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	find / -name '*.mp3' -print
2008-01-14T22:40:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what do you want to search for
2008-01-14T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	everything on your system except mp3s ?
2008-01-14T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what do you want to search for
2008-01-14T22:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	explain, your not making much sense
2008-01-14T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	what do you actually want to do ?
2008-01-14T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	I'm still not %100 clear what you actually wnat to do
2008-01-14T22:44:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	you realise you'll get 10000000's of results
2008-01-14T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	so then you don't need to search
2008-01-14T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	ls | -v .mp3
2008-02-05T21:27:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	logging info ? network devices, please be more specific
2008-02-05T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	are you running samba ?
2008-02-05T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	rich__	probably from that
