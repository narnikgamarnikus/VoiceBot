2005-09-12T12:12:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	it is not.
2005-09-12T12:13:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	they dont do the same thing?
2005-09-13T10:13:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	try /msg ubotu rar next time
2005-09-13T10:13:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	was that one line so obtrusive ?
2005-09-13T10:14:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	if you are seeking knowledge for yourself, why let everyone else know ?
2005-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	?
2005-09-20T16:01:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	have you tried running a partitioner from another terminal?
2005-09-20T16:02:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	i was asking what the command is and all i can get out of this channel so far is it did it for me....
2005-09-20T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	open another terminal from your installer (or use a livecd)
2005-09-20T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	in the new terminal, run your favorite disk partitioner
2005-09-20T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	when finished, return to the login window with the installation running in it
2005-09-20T16:03:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	finish your install
2005-09-20T16:04:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	that assumes a linux system on the box in question.   there is none.
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	you can do what i am telling you from the installer disk
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i had to do the same exact process on my mac the other day
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	the live cd wont boot in 32m ram  so it looks like this box can not run ubuntu.....  it can't run mdk either if that is any conciliation
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	you can partition with the install disk
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i can walk you through it (in another channel) if you like
2005-09-20T16:26:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	please return to school
2005-09-20T16:26:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i can help you now
2005-09-20T16:26:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	?
2005-09-20T16:27:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i have the information necessary to help you. return to school please
2005-09-20T16:27:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	?
2005-09-20T16:45:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	your disc is non standard
2005-09-20T16:45:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	a lot of those discs were not pressed correctly
2005-10-04T05:06:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	it's not hard
2005-10-04T05:06:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	it's impossible
2005-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	it doesnt. but if grub or lilo is living in the MBR, windows wont load if grub/lilo gets foobared
2005-10-04T05:26:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	just kick me out of here.  i don't use ubuntu anyway....
2005-10-05T06:09:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	try my suggestion
2005-10-16T12:16:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	malarkey in some places
2005-10-31T12:30:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	be clean and neat, recommend !checkinstall
2005-11-03T10:03:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	he's gone and that is not a good subject
2005-11-03T10:09:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	you know a command to scan for and fix broken deps ?
2005-11-03T10:10:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	"sudo apt-get -f install"
2005-11-06T11:39:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	if you remove a lot of pkgs in "ubuntu-desktop" it makes it crazy
2005-11-08T11:39:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	apt-cache searches on the local machine
2005-11-16T12:19:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	know the name of the program that runs automatic updates ?
2005-11-16T12:20:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i'm not familaer with it no
2005-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	build it from source repos
2005-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	i installed in from apt-get install one time before which, i would think, would mean that something on this system is messed up.
2005-11-16T09:38:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i dont know the hx of your box, you can try to have apt-get build it from source for yo
2005-11-17T13:00:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	build it
2005-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	why ?   why not fix what ever i broke ?
2005-11-17T13:01:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	idk what you broke, and you may have broken nothing
2005-11-17T13:02:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	usually 'not installable' means its not a binary for your arch
2005-11-17T13:02:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	i installed the same package a few months back and it installed no errors.
2005-11-17T13:03:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i'm only advising from what i see now
2005-11-17T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	ogg theora
2005-11-17T13:05:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	you lost me    <nalioth> intelikey: ogg theora
2005-11-17T13:05:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	ogg theora is the best, and i was aiming for i3dmaster, sorry
2005-11-17T13:08:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	you've been in here 24 hours or more on this, i'da done had apt-get build it and gone on
2005-11-17T13:10:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	about compiling from source, i don't have the space for all the build essentials and still compile it....  but i did check on that.
2005-11-30T15:46:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	there used to be a gui frontend for irssi, but the gui has fallen into neglect
2005-12-15T10:07:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	then when he uses /msg he'll learn
2005-12-27T11:17:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	you dont have a DNI ?
2005-12-27T11:17:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	Direct Neural Interface
2006-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	where indeed? i've been wondering that myself and nobody has ever answered it for me
2006-01-04T11:52:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	why are you repeating?
2006-03-08T10:57:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	it's destructive resizing
2006-03-08T10:58:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	you mean to tell me that M$ has not gotten past that yet......     damn !    that's really sad.
2006-03-08T11:03:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	you'll have to clue me in as to what you were referring to....   i see server messages scroll by along with channel messages  ?
2006-03-19T09:28:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	.twcrc ?
2006-03-19T09:29:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	er, .twmrc
2006-03-19T09:29:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	just make one ?    with the command i want to run in it ?
2006-03-19T09:29:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	there probably is no such thing as a .twmrc, i just said it to make you think
2006-03-25T13:24:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	/msg ubotu root
2006-03-25T13:25:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	read the page

2006-04-04T09:47:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	issue is blank
2006-04-04T09:47:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i'm lost
2006-04-15T10:12:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	yes it was i temper tantrum
2006-05-13T15:04:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	they change the bot all the time on things
2006-05-13T15:04:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	so i see.
2006-05-13T15:06:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	i posted a link to a last ditch effert to fix hosed installs.  and it keeps getting reset to nothing.
2006-05-13T15:59:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	yes?  ^
2006-05-13T16:00:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	yes
2006-05-13T16:13:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	i don't own windows machines and have not owned any since the year 2000. I'm very much not any good at samba
2006-05-27T12:44:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	'gksudo' please
2006-05-27T12:45:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	for anything gtk....  but gedit is not gtk is it ?"
2006-05-27T12:51:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	g-anything is pretty much assumed to be gtk
2006-05-27T12:51:00.000Z	intelikey	nalioth	has gedit ever offended X ?   i know nautilus does....
2006-05-27T12:52:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	best to use the rule "use gksudo for any superuser gtk tasks" then to start a list of proggies that do and do not take the priveleges and make merry
2006-05-27T12:53:00.000Z	nalioth	intelikey	join me in #ubuntu-offtopic please
