2007-08-17T15:01:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	have you done the stuff on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash?action=show&redirect=Flash#head-f036b17c3150dd72f58d952a0e13094568c9f92e
2007-08-17T15:05:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	it's in the repos; .7.2 in feisty-security, .8 in backports
2007-08-17T15:05:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	try the aoss option if you have sound issues, it's worked for a lot of people
2007-08-17T15:08:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	you might want to consider using firefox's automatic flash install instead of flashplugin-nonfree
2007-08-17T15:08:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	yeah, you've been messing with the files I'd suppose, get back to a baseline
2007-08-17T15:09:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	do sudo -i in a terminal, then cut and paste the command above
2007-08-17T15:12:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	type in a terminal(forget about the sudo -i, I rewrote the command):  sudo aptitude purge firefox && sudo aptitude purge flashplugin-nonfree && sudo aptitude install firefox flashplugin-nonfree
2007-08-17T15:15:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	no, it's just removing the ubuntu-desktop metapackage; its no big deal. You can add ubuntu-desktop to the end of the aptitude install if you like
2007-08-17T15:18:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	ok sudo aptitude install firefox ubuntu-desktop
2007-08-17T15:22:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	let's try this: go to youtube, and when it says it needs a plugin, let it install
2007-08-17T15:27:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	now go put the     FIREFOX_DSP="aoss"   in /etc/firefox/firefoxrc
2007-08-17T15:28:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	then restart firefox
2007-08-17T15:30:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	do gksudo gedit /etc/firefox/firefoxrc    ; the files in /etc are system files, and are owned by root.
2007-08-17T15:35:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	do    dpkg -l alsa-oss     in a terminal, are the two characters in the first two columns ii ?
2007-08-17T15:36:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	just the one line that has alsa-oss in it
2007-08-17T15:37:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	ok sudo aptitude install alsa-oss , then restart firefox
2007-08-17T15:39:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	then I've reached my limits here, sorry
2007-08-17T15:41:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	that's essentially what aoss is supposed to do.
2007-08-17T15:54:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	so, what was the fix?
2007-08-17T15:54:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	won't be thefirst time
2007-08-17T15:57:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	a sec.
2007-08-17T15:58:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	add http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34111/ to the end of /boot/grub/menu.lst , and windows will be on your boot menu
2007-08-17T15:59:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	ah, a sec
2007-08-17T16:01:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34111/ instead
2007-08-18T16:01:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	assuming it's the second drive on the first ide device
2007-08-18T16:03:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	what device does your windows drive show up as under /dev ? /dev/hdb, or what?
2007-08-18T16:03:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	sudo fdisk -l will tell you
2007-08-18T16:04:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	and there was a bit of a typo in the last one, I'll give you the correct one when you tell me which device has the ntfs partition
2007-08-18T16:05:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	ok, and which one is the ntfs partiton
2007-08-18T16:06:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	then I'll assume hda1 is the boot one; use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34115/
2007-08-18T16:06:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	bbinabit
2007-08-19T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	that's not how grub gets configured :)
2007-08-19T08:03:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	linux doesnt see it automatically which means i cant boot from it
2007-08-19T08:04:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	put the output of sudo fdisk -l    and a copy of /boot/grub/menu.lst on a pastebin, please
2007-08-19T08:05:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	fdisk -|
2007-08-19T08:05:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	ell, small l as in life
2007-08-19T08:08:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	what is the command line is it sudo boot/grub/menu.lst?
2007-08-19T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	just gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst, (for read only)
2007-08-19T08:10:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34253/
2007-08-19T08:11:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	me and indy are having a hard time trying to figure out where grub thinks my PATA drive is
2007-08-19T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	so am I :)
2007-08-19T08:11:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	thats my windows XP drive
2007-08-19T08:12:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	cool so that is the problem
2007-08-19T08:13:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	we need Lenord Nimoy to do an in search of episode...In search or Ben's Windows harddrive
2007-08-19T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34254/ . I've added a couple map commands (to fool windows about what's the first drive on the system) and changed the partition to the first one)
2007-08-19T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	one sec, I missed one thing
2007-08-19T08:15:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34255/ (forgot to change the drive as well)
2007-08-19T08:16:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	can i copy that and paste it in my grub folder
2007-08-19T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	I believe that windows stanza will work. Pelo, his windows is on the second drive, gotta fool windows :)
2007-08-19T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	just change the lines from 182 on down
2007-08-19T08:18:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	do I copy and past the that into my grub?
2007-08-19T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	let Pelo look first
2007-08-19T08:19:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	so dont use the one you sent?
2007-08-19T08:22:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	i did select all and delete then replaced it with your s and it wont save
2007-08-19T08:23:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	what can i do
2007-08-19T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	you really need to read up on sudo. /boot is a system area, to write you need to use gksudo gedit. I had you not use gksudo earlier, because we were only reading
2007-08-19T08:24:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	ok so i didnt mess anything up?
2007-08-19T08:24:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	no, you just couldn't write :0
2007-08-19T08:25:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	thanks for realizing im a nimwit
2007-08-19T08:25:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	nah, it's just a beginners hurdle, grokking admin privileges. Seen it many times, had to learn it myself ;)
2007-08-19T08:25:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	so i need to go into the root to make the changes right?
2007-08-19T08:26:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	anything that's outside of /home/<you> , yes
2007-08-19T08:27:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	how to i copy the pastebin info into my root grub
2007-08-19T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	in this order:   cd /boot/grub/     then  sudo cp menu.lst menu.lst.before.nickrud.messed.around    then   gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-08-19T08:29:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	your kiiding right
2007-08-19T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	well, maybe not all the nickrud stuff, but always back up system files before changing them
2007-08-19T08:30:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	i did the first part
2007-08-19T08:31:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	it says cp: missing destination file operand after `menu.lst'
2007-08-19T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	you can say cp menu.lst menu.lst.backup
2007-08-19T08:32:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	says permission denied
2007-08-19T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	that was a test, remember you're in system territory? use sudo
2007-08-19T08:33:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	cant i delete the current grub then ksut ceat a new one to take its place
2007-08-19T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	no! always make a backup in system territory, it's gonna save your system one day
2007-08-19T08:34:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	how do i know if it did it..it just went to a new line
2007-08-19T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	now you can do ls  , it'll list the files in the directory/folder
2007-08-19T08:35:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	ok it shows some stuff
2007-08-19T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	you see two menu.lst , one with backup appended, right?
2007-08-19T08:36:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	its only 4 lines i think i can post it here
2007-08-19T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	no, no more than three
2007-08-19T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	yup, you're good to go.
2007-08-19T08:37:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	now what do i do
2007-08-19T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	benn92647	/join #Pelo
2007-08-24T15:21:00.000Z	benn92647	nickrud	yes
