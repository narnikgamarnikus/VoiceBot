2008-02-05T15:36:00.000Z	phix		grrrrr, how can I disable the gnome network thingy?
2008-02-05T15:37:00.000Z	phix		gaim / pidgin just sits there waiting for the network to "come up", but it is up, it is just the gnome network thingy telling it the network is down
2008-02-05T15:37:00.000Z	phix		I am using a bridge
2008-02-05T15:37:00.000Z	phix		I dont want DHCP enabled on eth0
2008-02-05T15:38:00.000Z	phix		pele1:
2008-02-05T15:38:00.000Z	phix		yay
2008-02-05T15:38:00.000Z	phix		you have the same issue?
2008-02-05T15:39:00.000Z	phix		the interface I want DHCP enabled is br0
2008-02-05T15:39:00.000Z	phix		yet that is not a choice
2008-02-05T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	phrases like STFU are NOT welcome or appropirate for this channel
2008-02-05T15:40:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	oh ok :)
2008-02-05T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	if you can't describe a problem without using offensive phrases or language - don't
2008-02-05T15:41:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	hmmmm it makes me feel better :)
2008-02-05T15:41:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	ok I have calmed down, what should I do?
2008-02-05T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	describe the problem in simple clear english please.
2008-02-05T15:42:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	sure thing, gaim will not connect to network as it tells me it is waiting for the network to become available
2008-02-05T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	ok - is the network available, what type of network is it (wirless/wired local/internet)
2008-02-05T15:42:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	The icon in the system tray / notifaction bar tells me the network is down.  if I bring it up it tries to use DHCP on eth0, which is what I dont want, I have setup a bridge in /etc/network/interfaces
2008-02-05T15:42:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	wired
2008-02-05T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	please put your /etc/interfaces files in a pastebin please.
2008-02-05T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	/etc/network/interfaces sorry
2008-02-05T15:43:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	my network works :) I am speaking to you from the computer
2008-02-05T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	thats fine - please put the file I requested in the pastebin
2008-02-05T15:43:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	it is just gnome is telling me eth0 is down, but I dont care about that
2008-02-05T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	you've meeb warned about your langauge 2 times now
2008-02-05T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	your not sorry - you've just done this a minute ago with STFU and WTF
2008-02-05T15:47:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	oh yeah
2008-02-05T15:47:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	yeah
2008-02-05T15:48:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I cant paste
2008-02-05T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	why do you persist with bad language when you've been asked not to
2008-02-05T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	I have no interest in helping people who swear randomly into a channel of 1000+ users
2008-02-05T15:48:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	right, 3rd strike I am out, I get it
2008-02-05T15:48:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	hmmmm
2008-02-05T15:49:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	so why do you want to see my interface file for? it is nothing special
2008-02-05T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	it would have helped me understand your network setup
2008-02-05T15:49:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	can I prv msg it to you
2008-02-05T15:49:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I just told you
2008-02-05T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	I do not wish to private message from you
2008-02-05T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	telling me something and seeing how it is physically laid out is two seperate things.
2008-02-05T15:50:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	ok, fair enough, I have eth0 and ath0 (wifi), I have a bridge (br0) that bridges them together, it works great
2008-02-05T15:50:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	gnome network icon thingy is telling me my network is down (eth0) which is kind of true, it has no ip address assigned to it
2008-02-05T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	as I've just said - your desciption is not the same as seeing the file and how it's laid out. But as I've also said, I've no interest in helping someone who swears randomly.
2008-02-05T15:50:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	but other gnome programs, like gaim, believe gnome network thingy and just wait there for the network to come up
2008-02-05T15:51:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	am I swearing now?
2008-02-05T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	please stop messaging me
2008-02-05T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	you keep saying me name - that's addressing me.
2008-02-05T15:52:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	ok
2008-02-05T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	yes, I'm using it with nsswitch and pam
2008-02-05T15:59:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	weird
2008-02-05T16:01:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	sorry we got off on the wrong foot :) perhaps when I am awake later today I will be more plesent
2009-09-13T19:37:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	they don't use the same images
2009-09-13T19:37:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	can they read each other?
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	are there any tools to convert between the two/
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	I don't believe so
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	or should I just install SunOS now ? :)
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	and I don't believe so to your second question too
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	ok
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	should I turn to Solaris?
2009-09-13T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	that's up to you
2011-02-11T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	stop
2011-02-11T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	you know the topic, enough
2012-02-19T06:42:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	if they did, they would be asking for help
2012-02-19T06:43:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I just got back and dont want to read all of my logs, so I am advertising my availability
2012-02-19T06:43:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	please don't
2012-02-19T06:43:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	You sound like you need help, what can I do for you?
2012-02-19T06:43:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	you can stop randomly offering help, watch the channel, if people ask a question you can answer, jump in
2012-02-19T06:44:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	yes sir! I will try it your way
2012-11-30T18:55:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	drop the authoriterianess
2012-11-30T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	the language is unacceptable,
2012-11-30T18:58:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	If you get offended by language you may as well not speak to anyone
2012-11-30T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	the channel has rules on offensive language, then include no cursing, that's why he was pulled up on it
2012-11-30T18:59:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I wasn't offended
2012-11-30T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	it's not "my" rules, it's the channels, you're welcome to request discussion on it through the operators team
2012-11-30T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	it doesn't matter if you are offended or not in that respect, the channels rules are no cursing, if you are not happy with those rules a.) raise it as a concern to the operators team b.) don't use the channel
2012-11-30T18:59:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I prefer a over b
2012-11-30T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	I'll pm you the email address of the ubuntu IRC council and you can send you concerns to them
2012-11-30T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	great, b is a bad option
2012-11-30T19:00:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	I'll pm you the email address to send your complaint
2012-11-30T19:00:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	thank you
2012-11-30T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	drop it please.
2012-11-30T19:07:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I am not causing a problem
2012-11-30T19:07:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I am, asterisk is the full package, skype is just a service
2012-11-30T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	yes, he ants to use skype
2012-11-30T19:08:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	hmmmm
2012-11-30T19:08:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I am making things up?
2012-11-30T19:08:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	it is true though
2012-11-30T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	when you said skype is "off topic"
2012-11-30T19:10:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	ah ok
2012-11-30T19:10:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	well ActionParsnip argued / debated another point
2012-11-30T19:10:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	I agree now it is supported, I just looked it up :)
2012-11-30T19:11:00.000Z	phix	ikonia	really? is it a personal opionion that you can use asterisk as a full blown PBX? and have access to the source?
2012-11-30T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	please stop now, I'm getting board
2012-11-30T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	phix	the user wanted to connect to skype - he wanted the skype clients
