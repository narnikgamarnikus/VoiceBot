2006-01-14T12:07:00.000Z	p337		 trying to install drivers for my wireless card, any idea why i get this error? http://pastebin.com/497439
2006-01-14T12:08:00.000Z	p337		or anyone feel like walking me through the installation
2006-01-14T12:08:00.000Z	p337		or anyone know of a page that has information on installing http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm
2006-01-14T12:09:00.000Z	p337		i followed the readme exactly.... no luck
2006-01-14T12:10:00.000Z	sethk	p337	it isn't in the correct directory.  Not sure how it got that way, though.
2006-01-14T12:16:00.000Z	sethk	p337	forward slashes on real computers, not back slashes
2006-01-14T12:17:00.000Z	p337	sethk	i dont even think i was supposed to use that switch... but even if i dont i get the same error
2006-01-14T12:17:00.000Z	sethk	p337	there is no way you can get kerneldriversnet (concatenated like that) without supplying it somewhere.  configure doesn't invent strings of that sort.
2006-01-14T12:19:00.000Z	p337	sethk	 i dont get what you are saying it shows up as Module install directory : /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/kernel/drivers/net to me
2006-01-14T12:19:00.000Z	sethk	p337	in that case, you can't get the same error.
2006-01-14T12:20:00.000Z	sethk	p337	you said you get the same error, which would mean you get an error message with kerneldriversnet with no slashes in it.
2006-01-14T12:21:00.000Z	p337	sethk	http://pastebin.com/497456
2006-01-14T12:22:00.000Z	sethk	p337	i'd have to see the configure file.  almost always that sort of error is caused by an undefined macro.
2006-01-14T12:23:00.000Z	sethk	p337	if you like, sure, I'll take a look at it.  it may or may not help, but you have nothing to lose.
2006-01-14T12:24:00.000Z	p337	sethk	http://pastebin.com/497463
2006-01-14T12:25:00.000Z	sethk	p337	what was the line number again?  I closed the previous paste.
2006-01-14T12:26:00.000Z	p337	sethk	 where is that install directory it is talking about? or i guess where does it expect it to be?
2006-01-14T12:26:00.000Z	sethk	p337	wherever the source is unpacked.
2006-01-14T12:26:00.000Z	sethk	p337	ordinarily the same directory that configure is run from, although not always
2006-01-14T12:26:00.000Z	p337	sethk	 cause idont think i ever copied Makefile
2006-01-14T12:27:00.000Z	sethk	p337	no, the makefile is generated by ./configure
2006-01-14T12:28:00.000Z	sethk	p337	I see what's happening.  when it asks for the linux kernel source directory, you have to give it the linux kernel source directory.  Either you, or some script, is giving it "make install"
2006-01-14T12:29:00.000Z	p337	sethk	do i need to unpack that?
2006-01-14T12:29:00.000Z	sethk	p337	you did, or a script you ran did, because configure is inside the source directory
2006-01-14T12:29:00.000Z	sethk	p337	no, you can't get this far without first unpacking
2006-01-14T12:29:00.000Z	sethk	p337	are you typing "make install" ?
2006-01-14T12:30:00.000Z	p337	sethk	yes
2006-01-14T12:30:00.000Z	sethk	p337	it looks like, where you type that, you should be typing something like /usr/src/..... (wherever the kernel source lives)
2006-01-14T12:31:00.000Z	sethk	p337	ubuntu keeps the kernel source in a different directory (different than all the other distros)
2006-01-14T12:31:00.000Z	p337	sethk	-r'\kernel\drivers\net ?
2006-01-14T12:31:00.000Z	sethk	p337	no -r, no backslashes, and that's a _driver_ directory, you want the kernel source directory
2006-01-14T12:31:00.000Z	sethk	p337	first, do you have the kernel source installed?
2006-01-14T12:32:00.000Z	p337	sethk	.....i dont know
2006-01-14T12:32:00.000Z	sethk	p337	go into synaptic and find and install it.  If it is already installed, you'll see that in synaptic
2006-01-14T12:32:00.000Z	p337	sethk	oh.. i am using kubuntu if that matters
2006-01-14T12:33:00.000Z	p337	sethk	but i know thats the same as adept
2006-01-14T12:33:00.000Z	sethk	p337	for this case kubuntu and ubuntu are identical
2006-01-14T12:33:00.000Z	p337	sethk	is it linux-source?
2006-01-14T12:34:00.000Z	sethk	p337	that doesn't sound right.  I'm pretty sure you'll find the word "kernel" in the package name
2006-01-14T12:34:00.000Z	p337	sethk	kernel-package?
2006-01-14T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	p337	keep going.  the kernel _source_ is in a separate package.
2006-01-14T12:35:00.000Z	p337	sethk	doesnt find anything for kernel source
2006-01-14T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	p337	let me check the nname
2006-01-14T12:35:00.000Z	p337	sethk	ok
2006-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	p337	on my box I have kernel-source-2.6.11 and kernel-source-2.6.10
2006-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	p337	sethk	mine says linux-source-2.6.12
2006-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	p337	good.  But you said you didn't have one.  :)
2006-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	p337	do uname -a, make sure you are running 2.6.12
2006-01-14T12:38:00.000Z	p337	sethk	it says it is installed though
2006-01-14T12:39:00.000Z	sethk	p337	in that case, you need to type the kernel source path where you were typing "make install" before
2006-01-14T12:39:00.000Z	sethk	p337	look in /usr/src and find the source directory name
2006-01-14T12:40:00.000Z	p337	sethk	does it matter if it is just linux headers
2006-01-14T12:40:00.000Z	p337	sethk	linux source is there, but it is compressed
2006-01-14T12:40:00.000Z	sethk	p337	ok, then extract it.  you know how?
2006-01-14T12:40:00.000Z	sethk	p337	extract it into /usr/src.  then configure should find it without asking you for the path
2006-01-14T12:40:00.000Z	sethk	p337	hopefully, anyway.  you have to extract it regardless.
2006-01-14T12:41:00.000Z	p337	sethk	 i think last time i tried i got permission denied, how do i do it from command line so i can use sudo
2006-01-14T12:41:00.000Z	sethk	p337	why can't you use sudo?
2006-01-14T12:41:00.000Z	p337	sethk	from konqueror, i cannot
2006-01-14T12:41:00.000Z	p337	sethk	how do you unzip something from command line?
2006-01-14T12:41:00.000Z	sethk	p337	then do it from the command line.
2006-01-14T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	p337	it is probably a tar.bz2
2006-01-14T12:42:00.000Z	p337	sethk	yep
2006-01-14T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	p337	if so, you type:  tar xvjf whatever.tar.bz2
2006-01-14T12:42:00.000Z	p337	sethk	what is xvjf for?
2006-01-14T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	p337	x means extract, v means verbose, j means uncompress with bzip2, and f means you have a tar file.
2006-01-14T12:43:00.000Z	p337	sethk	ah thanks
2006-01-14T12:43:00.000Z	sethk	p337	f is an anachronism.  tar means "tape archiver" and without an f it looks for a tape drive
2006-01-14T12:43:00.000Z	p337	sethk	ah...
2006-01-14T12:44:00.000Z	p337	sethk	woo extracting
2006-01-14T12:44:00.000Z	p337	sethk	ok thats all done, do i go and do make install again?
2006-01-14T12:45:00.000Z	sethk	p337	try it.  ordinarily configure is run first, but if that's what the instructions call for, then yes, do that.
2006-01-14T12:45:00.000Z	p337	sethk	yeah it says make config first
2006-01-14T12:46:00.000Z	p337	sethk	seems like the same error
2006-01-14T12:46:00.000Z	p337	sethk	make: binary operator expected
2006-01-14T12:46:00.000Z	sethk	p337	then you'll have to type in the directory name.
2006-01-14T12:46:00.000Z	sethk	p337	if you type "make install" at that point, you'll always get the same result
2006-01-14T12:47:00.000Z	p337	sethk	ah.. what directory?
2006-01-14T12:47:00.000Z	sethk	p337	it prompts you for the kernel source directory.  give it the kernel source directory
2006-01-14T12:47:00.000Z	p337	sethk	oh
2006-01-14T12:47:00.000Z	p337	sethk	so like make usr/src.linux-source-2.6.12/install ?
2006-01-14T12:48:00.000Z	sethk	p337	I'm not sure I don't have it in front of me.  However, /usr, not just usr.
2006-01-14T12:48:00.000Z	p337	sethk	alright
2006-01-14T12:48:00.000Z	sethk	p337	normally the argument to make is a target.
2006-01-14T12:48:00.000Z	sethk	p337	what I saw in the configure script is that it prompts for the kernel path.  that may be hidden within a script.
2006-01-14T12:51:00.000Z	p337	sethk	nothing is working
2006-01-14T12:51:00.000Z	sethk	p337	try the normal way to install source, which is:  ./configure
2006-01-14T12:51:00.000Z	sethk	p337	as step one.  in the source directory.  assuming you know where that is
2006-01-14T12:53:00.000Z	p337	sethk	http://pastebin.com/497474
2006-01-14T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	p337	make /usr/src/linux-2.6.12-10-386 a symbolic link to the actually kernel source directory.
2006-01-14T12:54:00.000Z	p337	sethk	i have that to
2006-01-14T12:54:00.000Z	sethk	p337	then what you extracted is not the kernel source
2006-01-14T13:33:00.000Z	p337	sethk	timfrost should i try this one?
