2006-01-16T07:09:00.000Z	C-O-L-T		how to have quick time plugin for firefox ?
2006-01-16T07:10:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	use mplayerplug-in
2006-01-16T07:10:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	the packageg name is 'mozilla-mplayer' but you'll need to install mplayer first.  Ubotu sent you some info on how to do that.
2006-01-21T12:50:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	what are you installing?
2006-01-21T12:51:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	Office suite
2006-01-21T12:51:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	open office?
2006-01-21T12:52:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I have forgotten it's name
2006-01-21T12:52:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	no no it is not free it's name begins with T and it looks like microsoft office
2006-01-21T12:53:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	if you trust the source and don't mind running random things from random people on your box.... try 'sh file.sh' or 'chmod +x filename.sh && ./filename.sh'
2006-01-21T12:53:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	as I see it works with sh file.sh I will give the program name in a few moments
2006-01-21T12:54:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	that's ok
2006-01-21T12:54:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	it asks me to login as administrator in terminal how to do that?
2006-01-21T13:03:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	is Thinkfree Office 3.0
2006-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	I think the gimp site has a tutorial for that
2006-01-24T14:50:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	i will look at it
2006-01-24T14:51:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I got it at their website
2006-01-24T14:52:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	k
2006-01-26T15:17:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	you can use the -d option to download using apt-get.  Or packages.ubuntu.com
2006-01-26T15:19:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I would like to install somewhere ubuntu but that person has a really slow connection, so it would take to him days for downloading all the updates, can I just simply download them?
2006-01-26T15:19:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	you can as long as you make sure you get all the dependencies as well
2006-01-26T15:20:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	someone may know of a better way, that's the only way I know
2006-01-26T15:38:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AptMoveHowto seems to be what you want
2006-01-26T15:40:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I deleted the packages that were in var folder so I can not write them. I deleted them for freeing up space. So I will enable the repositories in synaptic and after that I will wait till installs everything
2006-01-26T16:14:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	you around?
2006-01-26T16:14:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	yes
2006-01-26T16:14:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	http://cargol.net/~ramon/ubuntu-dvd-en
2006-01-26T16:15:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	:( I don't have a dvd writer
2006-01-26T16:16:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	just cd writer
2006-01-26T16:16:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	if you weed out enough packages you can probably still do it.  You just want multiverse
2006-01-26T16:17:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	i will leave my collegues computer working all night cause it is easier :) for me
2006-01-26T16:19:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	but i need your help in another thing
2006-01-26T16:20:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	are you around?
2006-01-26T16:20:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	yeah
2006-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I need a program which can make me slideshows of my pictures with music in vcd or svcs or avi format, but especially vcd, and svcd
2006-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	please tell me that there is one
2006-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	there is one
2006-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	cause I am looking for it for weeks
2006-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	which one
2006-01-26T16:21:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	I actually don't know myself, I have never done it
2006-01-26T16:22:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	than why are you saying that there is one
2006-01-26T16:22:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	you asked me to :)
2006-01-26T16:23:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	:)) don't joke with me, I would like to make a beautifull things for my classmates , but I don't have the software
2006-01-26T16:25:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	Ask somebody please who you know about this kind of software, I am looking for it for 3 weeks and I am getting really nervous
2006-01-26T16:26:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	qdvdauthor seems to do it... maybe it can do vcd's?  worth a try... may also want to look at http://tovid.berlios.de/en/tovid.html
2006-01-26T16:27:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	seems like a lot of your problems could be solved with a dvd burner
2006-01-26T16:28:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	yes I know, but I don't have the funds for it. Anyway where can I download this program, it seems that can make vcd/svcd
2006-01-26T16:29:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	apparently mencoder can do it as well, the tovid thing is on that page I gave you 'get tovid'
2006-01-26T16:30:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I will try both of them
2006-01-26T16:31:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	can I get mencoder in synaptic?
2006-01-26T16:31:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	yeah, comes with mplayer.  You'll have to see if it can actually do it though
2006-01-26T16:31:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I could not get it
2006-01-26T16:32:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I don't have mplayer
2006-01-26T16:32:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I need to install it?
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	help me in installing tovid cause I can not
2006-01-26T16:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I am following the directions but I still can not
2006-01-26T16:39:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	make sure you have multiverse
2006-01-26T16:39:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	I have multiuniverse enabled
2006-01-26T16:40:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	what error are you getting

2006-01-26T16:42:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	I have no idea about tovidI think you need to install all that stuff it says you are missing
2006-01-26T16:42:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	_jason	should i try the other program
2006-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	_jason	C-O-L-T	it's a dependency anyway so sure
