2008-07-11T03:20:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	just prefix statements with my nick and some punctuation; that should help
2008-07-11T03:21:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Standard etiquette yes.
2008-07-11T03:22:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	please add the output from `dmesg ; cat /proc/interrupts' to that pastebin

2008-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	sec
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	which applications are affected by this?  Are you using a default install without customisations to sound dialogues?  (i.e., PulseAudio)
2008-07-11T03:27:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Audacious and mplayer both suffer from it.
2008-07-11T03:27:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	are web browsers with, say, a Java and/or Flash plugin, ever involved?
2008-07-11T03:27:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Firefox's flash also suffers but there the video and audio don't even synch as in mplayer.
2008-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	As for sound dialogues customisations, I turned off system sounds.
2008-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	I.e. login and logout sounds.
2008-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	to be precise, if you _only_ use audacious [but no web browser or Java app], is the symptom exhibited?
2008-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Will test.
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	46 seconds in.
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Audacious lasts about twice as long before cutting.
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Will say when it continues.
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	and this is from a fresh boot?
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Yup.
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	_without_ having opened a web browser.
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Without having Firefox open.
2008-07-11T03:31:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Closed it when you said it.
2008-07-11T03:31:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	do you still have the desktop cd handy?  if so, can you reproduce it from a fresh boot using it?
2008-07-11T03:32:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	I have the desk-song continues-
2008-07-11T03:32:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	I have the desktop CD yes.  Used it to reinstall Ubuntu earlier this evening.
2008-07-11T03:33:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	ok, please boot from the desktop cd, install audacious and whatnot, and attempt to reproduce the issue running directly from the live cd
2008-07-11T03:33:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	And it's cut at 1:50 again.
2008-07-11T03:34:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	And song continues :)
2008-07-11T03:34:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	 And cut, this was short at 2:11, Either way, so boot from Live CD, install Audacious and Irssi and report back?
2008-07-11T03:34:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	yes, please, thanks.
2008-07-11T03:35:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Okay, I'll be back in a few minutes.
2008-07-11T03:49:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Okay, currently on the live CD.
2008-07-11T03:49:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	And currently playing the same song.
2008-07-11T03:50:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	ok, let me know if the symptom is reproducible.
2008-07-11T03:50:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	1:18.
2008-07-11T03:51:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	is the desktop cd you're using 8.04 or 8.04.1?
2008-07-11T03:51:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	No idea.
2008-07-11T03:52:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	lsb_release -r
2008-07-11T03:52:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	sorry, lsb_release -d
2008-07-11T03:52:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	8.04
2008-07-11T03:53:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Same.
2008-07-11T03:53:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	ok, then it's definitely not a software regression
2008-07-11T03:53:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Aye.
2008-07-11T03:53:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	check `dmesg' for any unusual output.
2008-07-11T03:54:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Define unusual output please.
2008-07-11T03:54:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	anything along the lines of "codec timed out", etc.
2008-07-11T03:54:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	it would appear via `dmesg|tail'
2008-07-11T03:55:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Nothing on the keyword 'codec'.
2008-07-11T03:56:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	ok, I don't know how much further you want to chase the issue, which appears to be hardware-based.
2008-07-11T03:56:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Saw that coming.
2008-07-11T03:57:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	if you want, you can see if the symptom is tickled with an older kernel, though I think that's fairly unlikely.  Try the 7.10 desktop cd.
2008-07-11T03:57:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Any idea how it's possible?
2008-07-11T03:57:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	I mean, the sound quality is still great.
2008-07-11T03:58:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Don't have a 7.10 lying around iirc.
2008-07-11T03:58:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Perhaps the Alternative CD, but that isn't a fast/easy solution.
2008-07-11T03:59:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	sure, there are myriad possibilities from dying HD to dying ac'97 codec...
2008-07-11T04:00:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	hmm.  Is the media file on your local HD or on an external usb mass storage device?
2008-07-11T04:01:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	First run it was on my HD, now I've copied it to my iPod as to play it back under the Live CD.
2008-07-11T04:01:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	hmm, there's a possible usb controller issue, but I don't think it's too likely [yet]
2008-07-11T04:02:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	if you play the same song (so that it's cached), is the symptom reproducible?
2008-07-11T04:02:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	That would mean both my HD is failing AND my USB ports are fucked.  How likely are both outside of the motherboard just being dead, which isn't the case I assuem since I can still use my PC.
2008-07-11T04:02:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Will try.
2008-07-11T04:03:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Stop > Play.
2008-07-11T04:05:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Thinking perhaps RAM faillure?  Song's playing fine thus far, the stuff it has already played before.
2008-07-11T04:07:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	It played back completely this time.  Now I'm totally lost, hehe.
2008-07-11T04:07:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	I would not suspect bad RAM.
2008-07-11T04:08:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	I would suspect a controller issue if it is in fact reproducible across usb mass storage devices
2008-07-11T04:08:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Ok, and the song played find after having it play to about halfway before.
2008-07-11T04:08:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Which controller?
2008-07-11T04:08:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	usb 2.0
2008-07-11T04:08:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	That would mean it should play fine over HD, no?
2008-07-11T04:09:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Which as we already found out was not the case.
2008-07-11T04:09:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	note that I'm glossing over some issues; it's not necessarily hardware; it can be a kernel issue.  There's at least one known kernel issue with usb 2.0 controllers.
2008-07-11T04:09:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Shall I mount the HD again and play the same song stored there?
2008-07-11T04:10:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	and/or try a different one not cached in RAM
2008-07-11T04:10:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Will try both.
2008-07-11T04:11:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Same song, on HD.
2008-07-11T04:15:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Same song, only on HD, plays back fine.  Trying a different song on the HD now.
2008-07-11T04:19:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	The different, shorter and lower bitrate, song played back completely.
2008-07-11T04:19:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Questionmarks as to what the heck's happening are growing, hehehe.
2008-07-11T04:23:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Copy?
2008-07-11T04:41:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	right
2008-07-11T04:42:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Any ideas?
2008-07-11T04:42:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	at this point, because we've ruled out ALSA and PulseAudio, you'd need to do some legwork on patterns
2008-07-11T04:43:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Okay.  No idea what you mean.
2008-07-11T04:43:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	I mean that you can see under what conditions the freezes occur.  Only after a fresh boot while playing media from local HD? etc.
2008-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Ah, that kind of patterning.
2008-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	without using systrace, it's a bit difficult for me to continue.
2008-07-11T04:44:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Okay.
2008-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	crimsun	rgb	sorry, mean systemtap
2008-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Don't know that program either, so doesn't make much difference.
2008-07-11T04:47:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Any idea on how it's related to video and those interupting during playback?
2008-07-11T04:55:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	I will do some patterning tomorrow.  Going to sleep for now.  Thanks for the help, and good night.
2008-07-15T16:23:00.000Z	rgb	crimsun	Hello, you there?
