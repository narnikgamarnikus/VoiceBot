2006-01-28T10:34:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	then you have a problem ...
2006-01-28T10:35:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	??
2006-01-28T10:35:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	you need to stop calling him ^^
2006-01-28T10:35:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	heheh, mainly via IM or Nextel DC
2006-01-28T10:36:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	you need to get rid of all wired in the computer room that can possibly carry a network connection, remove all window (make the solid walls) then paint the room with aluminum based paint
2006-01-28T10:36:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	um, tree?
2006-01-28T10:37:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	that is my way of saying you lost me
2006-01-28T10:37:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	the point was to cut off all your ability to communicate outside the room ...
2006-01-28T10:38:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	ah :)
2006-01-28T10:38:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	he understands now, he installed it thursday cause of my ranting and about 15 min later I got a call and he was like "dude, ubunut rules"
2006-01-28T10:50:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	what do you use right now?
2006-01-28T10:52:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	is firefox set as the default browser?
2006-01-28T10:52:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I think so, if the only place you set that is in firefox
2006-01-28T10:54:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	http://kb.mozillazine.org/Setting_Your_Default_Browser
2006-01-28T10:55:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	that was done using google :)
2006-01-28T10:56:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	see, I always think I need the ubuntu forums
2006-01-28T10:58:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	it is set as default "firefox %s" is in the box just like the doc you had me read says but clicking on a link still does nothing
2006-01-28T10:58:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	read on, it tells you how to reconfigure that.
2006-01-28T11:00:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	when I run update-alternatives --config x-www-browser
2006-01-28T11:00:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	it says I have only one browser installed
2006-01-28T11:04:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	There is only 1 program which provides x-www-browser
2006-01-28T11:04:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	try installing mozilla or some other browser and set that as default, the set firefox as default again ...
2006-01-28T11:04:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	will do
2006-01-28T11:05:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	things like that can happen in windows ... sometimes programs request a special browser instead of the default one
2006-01-28T11:06:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I am not using windows???
2006-01-28T11:06:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	scroll down more
2006-01-28T11:06:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I went to the end
2006-01-28T11:07:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	I will pm you, the passage, ok?
2006-01-28T11:07:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	sure
2006-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I did a google search on creating a symlink for firefox 1.5 and it is on the ubuntu forums :) guess I will find the answer when the forums are back up
2006-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	you are using badger?
2006-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	did you set up  1.5 the same way as in the wiki guide?
2006-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	automaix set up my firefox
2006-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	yeah, on ubuntu 5.10
2006-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	did I break it heheh :)
2006-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	no clue
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	no worries, like I said, according to my google search the answer is on the forums and they will be back up soon
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	did you try the google cache file?
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	no, good idea
2006-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	my browser issue is fixed, thanks
2006-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	did you do what the guide said?
2006-01-28T11:36:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	even Linux is not free of problems that Windows had first. ^^
2006-01-28T11:37:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I did the symlink stuff
2006-01-28T11:38:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I know all OS's have their issues, I just like linux's issues more :)
2006-01-28T11:39:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	I don't ... because I don't know how to fix them. :(
2006-01-28T11:39:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	you just did
2006-01-28T11:39:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	google the problem and find the solution
2006-01-28T11:40:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	where do the $PATh and the $SHELL variables get set?
2006-01-28T11:41:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	in windows?
2006-01-28T11:41:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	on linux ...
2006-01-28T11:41:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	hehehe, I don't know
2006-01-28T11:41:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I can tell you on windows
2006-01-28T11:42:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	I need it for linux
2006-01-28T11:42:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	soory too new to linux
2006-01-28T11:43:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	exactly ...
2006-01-28T11:44:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I did a google search on " where do the $PATh and the $SHELL variables get set in linux" and it has some interesting results
2006-01-28T11:44:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	it also depends on the distro
2006-01-28T11:45:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	which was why I was in the habit of just doing those searches on the ubuntu forums
2006-01-28T11:54:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	apt-get install best-os-evar
2006-01-28T12:19:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	ubuntu is not a real package
2006-01-28T12:19:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	so it is safe to proceed
2006-01-28T12:19:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	from what I've been told, yes.
2006-01-28T12:20:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I like your anser :)
2006-01-28T12:20:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	my understanding is that ubuntu-desktop is there to require a load of other packages, some which maybe be useless.
2006-01-28T12:20:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	and I am wanting to remove some of them
2006-01-28T12:20:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I was just afraid it would remove all of them
2006-01-28T12:39:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	I'd say yes, but I read of a problem that required 32bit os to get ndiswrapper to work
2006-01-28T12:39:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	and if I am not using ndiswrapper?
2006-01-28T12:40:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	i was just scared that there would be lots of issues
2006-01-28T12:40:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	it depends on the windows driver for the card
2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	what depends on the windows driver?
2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	the way it was ... 64bit os, 64bit ndiswrapper, no 64bit windows driver
2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	ah, ok
2006-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	so if i don't use any windows drivers I am ok
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	should be
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	that is the only problem I read about with 64bit os
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	converting will require a format and reinstall correct?
2006-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	probably
2006-01-28T12:43:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	the funny part is that anandtech had an article about gcc 3.3 optimizing 32bit code better than gcc 4.0, while gcc 4.0 did that for 64bit code.
2006-01-28T12:43:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	well, I have gcc 3.3 and 4.0 installed and run the one I need anyways
2006-01-28T12:44:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	some aps require gcc 3.3 to compile correct
2006-01-28T12:44:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	was about to say that
2006-01-28T12:44:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	I am kinda proud I even install this with as little linux exp as I have
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	slavik	galgoz	trust me, you are not far behind me on *nix experience :)
2006-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	galgoz	slavik	where you at?
