2009-02-12T17:36:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		Can anyone here tell me how to connect to my mobile phone to notebook using Infrared?
2009-02-12T17:37:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		HOw do I activate the Infrared
2009-02-12T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	does lspci show it?
2009-02-12T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	it may come up as an IrDA device
2009-02-12T17:40:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	No.
2009-02-12T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	or may say infared
2009-02-12T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	try lsusb
2009-02-12T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	it may be attatched to the usb bus
2009-02-12T17:42:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Nothing their either... Only thing remotely possible is the Wireless ethernet. :(
2009-02-12T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	is it enabled in the bios?
2009-02-12T17:42:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	No idea...  I presumed it was... shall I reboot and check?
2009-02-12T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	i would as a starting point
2009-02-12T17:43:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Okay, let me do that then... be back in a bit.
2009-02-12T17:53:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Okay, it was disabled in the BIOS.  I enabled it, but lspci and lsusb still show nothing that looks like it is an Infrared.
2009-02-12T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	can you pastebin both outputs please, use a single link too ;)
2009-02-12T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	pretty much sets up your entire laptop :D
2009-02-12T18:10:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	:)  Let me have a looksie.
2009-02-12T18:22:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Okay, I checked that site out and it does not seem to say much about using the Infrared.  I did run a sudo irdadump and it scrolled some info but nothing that really helps me to know whether it is trying to connect to my mobile phone or not.
2009-02-12T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	we just need to get the infared working first
2009-02-12T18:27:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I know :\
2009-02-12T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	if you run lsmod and make sure you have all the same modules as are listed in the link I gave then you should be ok
2009-02-12T18:30:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Hmmm... I see.
2009-02-12T18:42:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Can you at least tlel me how to communicate with the IRDA?
2009-02-12T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	i've never used it. I thought it was kinda defunct now with bluetooth being so prollific
2009-02-12T18:50:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Okay.
2009-02-12T18:53:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Just wnated to see if I could do it... but seems it is beyond me.
2009-02-12T18:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	i'd have a go if you get free time, i'm sure its achievable
2009-02-12T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	try: sudo findchip -v
2009-02-12T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-253388.html
2009-02-12T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	try: ls /dev/ir*
2009-02-12T19:02:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	nothing
2009-02-12T19:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	maybe its just a generic case but theres no IR sender/reciever
2009-02-12T19:04:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I think I am too dumb for this.
2009-02-12T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	just keep at it. as far as the guides have said I dont think it has infared. But i could be wrong. Have a swing at it if you get time. IBM supprt linux very well
2009-02-12T19:06:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	check http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-55318  There is says (and shows a picture) of the infrared port.
2009-02-12T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	doesnt mean theres an IR sender behind it
2009-02-12T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	dos the system have windows on it too?
2009-02-12T19:08:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	No.
2010-04-10T19:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	check in language under administration (remembering here, I'm on the move)
2010-04-10T19:28:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Okay, be right back.
2010-06-28T20:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	cd /var/cache/apt/archives; sudo dpkg -i ./*.deb
2010-06-28T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	when you get your new allowance, complete the upgrade
2010-06-28T20:37:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I hear you... and you dajhorn ... Ai, just that the system is really uncomfortable... but I will hold out then.
2010-06-28T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	if you are jumping to the next release, grab the alternate cd iso at a friends place / work. burn it after md5 testing it then use that ;)
2011-02-02T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	boot to root recovery mode and do it there
2011-02-02T00:47:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	But what do I do?
2011-02-02T00:48:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	You mean do the xorg -configure form the boot recovery?
2011-02-02T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	hold shift at boot, select recovery mode then select root.  You cannot run that command with an active x running as far as I remember
2011-02-02T00:48:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Or activate root from boot recovery?
2011-02-02T00:48:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Thank you :)
2011-02-02T12:25:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I think he wants to know how to add Windows 7 to his grub loader as a bootable option.
2011-02-02T12:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	now you meantion it...yeah seems that way
2011-02-02T13:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	maybe kill the xorg process. You will lose any unsavedwork. Does K+ALT+PrintScreen not kill it?
2011-02-02T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	its the kill X combo because some folks (I have no idea who) were presing it and losing work, or similar
2011-06-01T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	if your ubuntu is 64bit there is a ppa for 64bit flash. There is also o
2011-06-01T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	i'd say it was all linux_hacks ;-)
2012-01-30T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	use bleachbit carefully as root and your user with as many apps closed as possible
2012-08-08T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	I believe evolution can use PST files
2012-08-15T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	can you give a PASTEBIN of the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'
2012-08-15T19:04:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1148957/
2012-08-15T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	sudo apt-get --purge remove flashplugin-installer flashplugin-nonfree libswfdec-0.8-0 swfdec-mozilla      then enable the partner repo and install adobe-flashplugin
2012-08-15T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	Lucid desktop support dies in April 2013, I suggest you upgrade soon
2012-08-15T19:05:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Um, let me try that.... Wish me luck.
2012-08-15T19:07:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Will do, thank you.
2012-08-15T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	that lotwill give you 64bit flash for your 64it OS, should be ok
2012-08-15T19:10:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	If the sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin works without activating the partner repo does that mean it was already activated previously?
2012-08-15T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	yes, thats where the package comes from :)
2012-08-15T19:11:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Okies, busy downlaoding the adobe-flashplugin.  thank you.
2012-08-15T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	should be a bit better
2012-08-15T19:21:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I am back, and it worked perfectly.  Thank you.
2012-08-15T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	np dude :)
2012-08-21T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	it can, yes
2012-08-21T19:49:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Oh, then something else went wrong with ym NT4 installation in virtualbox.
2012-08-21T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	does NT4 work in vbox?
2012-08-21T19:50:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I do not know.  I tried Virtualbox
2012-08-21T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	then I suggest you check the vbox site to check, should've done that first really...
2012-08-21T19:51:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I presumes Virtualbox would have done the trick for me.
2012-08-21T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	it doesn't work with every OS ever
2012-08-21T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes    for example PCBSD won't run
2012-08-21T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	is yourinstall media up to SP6a?
2012-08-21T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	it may help, you can add the repo and install easier
2012-08-21T20:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	libreoffice is a fork of openoffice
2012-08-23T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	depends on taste
2012-08-23T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	mutt, clawsmail, thunderbird, kmail are 4 I can think of quickly. Depends how much space you have for deps to install kmail

2012-09-17T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	if you are using Chrome you can uninstall flashplugin-installer and get flash as it is already in the browser
2012-09-17T10:05:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	I am using Chromium.
2012-09-17T10:05:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	Do you advise me to uninstall Chromium and install Chrome instead?
2012-09-17T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ascavasaion	ah, then uninstall the flashplugin-installer package and enable the partner repo and install adobe-flashplugin. Natty is EOL next month so you may want to consider updating
2012-09-17T10:07:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	ActionParsnip	kay, thank you.
