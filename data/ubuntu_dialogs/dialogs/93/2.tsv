2012-06-07T03:18:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	is that drive on NTFS or FAT?
2012-06-07T03:19:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	the drive im having issues with is ext4
2012-06-07T03:19:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	what does "mount" show as the mount options
2012-06-07T03:22:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027743/
2012-06-07T03:24:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	nothing is currently mounted on /media/backup. you need to mount it and then run "mount"
2012-06-07T03:25:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	you also have someone logged in on a root gnome session (/root/.gvfs is mounted) that could be the cause of your problems. in a race to see who gets to mount the drive first if root wins..
2012-06-07T03:27:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027749/. whats this root gnome session thing? can you explain that?
2012-06-07T03:28:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	you are doing something strange to get a root session. im not sure what it is, but generally you would not want root to be running services like gnome-vfs. did you do anything like running "sudo gnome-session" or anything like that
2012-06-07T03:29:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	the drive is mounted read-write so what does it say when you say touch /media/livebackup1010/test.txt
2012-06-07T03:31:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	sorry that last entry was directed to you
2012-06-07T03:31:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	chown username:username would allow you to take ownership of the files. it should not reduce your permissions. it is increasing your permissions
2012-06-07T03:32:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	 /media/livebackup1010/test.txt  doesnt exist. and id like to make the permissions as before. id only like to increase the permissions of that one file. not the entire partition.
2012-06-07T03:33:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	paste the output of ls -l /media and ls -l /media/livebackup1010
2012-06-07T03:36:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027636/ for backup. thats the partition im having an issue with
2012-06-07T03:39:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	permissions on . are a little odd (700) means that homer AND ONLY homer can create files or subfolders in that folder, but i dont see anything that would prevent homer from creating or modifying files
2012-06-07T03:39:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	with the exception of lost+found but thats commonly held by root
2012-06-07T03:39:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027764/
2012-06-07T03:40:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	i dont want it that only homer can create files or subfolders in the hd. how do i fix that?
2012-06-07T03:41:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	what happens when you do the touch in the commands you just sent without the sudo?
2012-06-07T03:42:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	not sure what you mean by touch. does touch mean just do the same commands sans sudo?
2012-06-07T03:44:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	i just did blkid and sudo blkid http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027768/
2012-06-07T03:45:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	if you want broader permissions on the directory then you would chmod ### where the # values are for user, group, other respectively, 7 means create or delete files, and 5 means list files, and no other value is really meaningful or useful for directories
2012-06-07T03:45:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	blkid is not helpful run the set of commands i just sent
2012-06-07T03:45:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	^^^

2012-06-07T03:51:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	you are getting io errors and the /dev/sdb2 doesn't exist which suggests that the device is failing and has been ejected from the system. how is it connected?
2012-06-07T03:53:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	its connected by usb
2012-06-07T03:53:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	lets look at dmesg | tail -n 100
2012-06-07T03:55:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027784/
2012-06-07T03:58:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	no additional information there. its just an io error? might you have jostled the cord? check the smart status of the disk with the disk utility gui
2012-06-07T03:59:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	i checked smart status. green light. disk is healthy.
2012-06-07T04:00:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	really hard to say. is it connected to a usb extension hub, or directly to the computer?
2012-06-07T04:00:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	directly to the computer.
2012-06-07T04:01:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	might it be a power issue? is the drive independently powered or does it rely on usb hub power?
2012-06-07T04:01:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	are you running on AC or battery
2012-06-07T04:02:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	it relies on usb power. computer plugged in
2012-06-07T04:02:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	are you running on AC or battery? do you have a lot of other usb devices connected that need usb hub power?
2012-06-07T04:04:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	computer is plugged in. i have nothing else connected to the computer except for this ext hd with two partitions. i can't drag and drop files into the partition but i can copy them onto the computer.
2012-06-07T04:04:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	the whole "drag and drop" is a few steps ahead of us at the moment. i want to know why your disk was spontaneously ejected from the system
2012-06-07T04:05:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	sorry. yes.
2012-06-07T04:05:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	according to nautilus its connected
2012-06-07T04:06:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	this is sooo weird, indeed. and thx for your help. you really know how to troubleshoot.
2012-06-07T04:06:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	why dont you eject the disk. remove it. replug it, and then try those commands i sent you earlier
2012-06-07T04:07:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	ok
2012-06-07T04:07:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/; ls -la /mnt; sudo touch /mnt/test_file_creation_root ; touch /mnt_test_file_creation_nonroot; ls -la /mnt; whoami
2012-06-07T04:11:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027801/ same exact print out. and the  ext hard drive is connected!
2012-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	did you issue the mount command first?
2012-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	nooo. ugh!
2012-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	dont give me last test this test. give the pure unadulterated session
2012-06-07T04:12:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	from the moment you plug it in, and dont click anything in the gui
2012-06-07T04:16:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027810/
2012-06-07T04:17:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	i see you are trying to mount sdb, you want sdc. i was modifying your original commands and didn't notice the change.
2012-06-07T04:18:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	ok doing it all over. lol...i didnt notice either
2012-06-07T04:18:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	try "ls -la /media/backup1010ext4; sudo touch /media/backup1010ext4/test_root; touch /media/backup1010ext4/test_nonroot; ls -la /media/backup1010ext4; whoami
2012-06-07T04:38:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	screenshots of what you are doing. thats all i can think of at this point
2012-06-07T04:26:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027822/
2012-06-07T04:27:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	left out the crucial ls /media/backup1010ext4 but it seems to be working
2012-06-07T04:31:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	its there.  ls -la /media/backup1010ext4
2012-06-07T04:34:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	"Error while copying to "external hard drive". The destination is read-only. argh!!!!!! same error! doesnt make any sense at all!
2012-06-07T04:35:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	what gui tool is this and who is it running as?
2012-06-07T04:35:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	ps aux | grep nautilus; lets see what that says
2012-06-07T04:37:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027829/
2012-06-07T04:40:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	ok! here we go! but one last thing before i do that. the permissions i have set up for the ext hd: backup1010...were changed that homer is the only person who can read and write on the disk. how can i change it so anyone can read and write on the disk?
2012-06-07T04:43:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	so for directories the only permissions that make much sense are 7 (full access to that folder meaning creating, renaming, and deleting files) and 5 meaning (list the contents of the folder-- reading the files is controlled by the files permissions). so 777 means anyone can modify the folder contents 755 means only you can modify the contents but anyone can read them, and 770 means that you or your group can modify the contents
2012-06-07T04:44:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	do you think that might make a difference? im gonna try, anywhich way!
2012-06-07T04:45:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	it shouldnt make any difference
2012-06-07T04:53:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://imagebin.org/215438
2012-06-07T04:55:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://imagebin.org/215439
2012-06-07T04:55:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	can you send me the "mount" output one more time
2012-06-07T04:57:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1027853/
2012-06-07T04:59:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	i dont know
2012-06-07T05:00:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	do you think if just get a new ext hd. connect this one to a diff linux set up and then transfer the files over to the new hd there will be no problem? sorry. i thinkim loopy from spedning like 3 hours trying to troubleshoot this.
2012-06-07T05:01:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	i mean copy files from the ext hd thats acting weird onto a new hd. or will the permissions on the new for the files be the same?
2012-06-07T05:01:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	its really confusing with the number of external disks you have plugged into that system, but (if im looking at the right devices) it should be working. i dont know what to tell you
2012-06-07T05:02:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	if the drive were to suddenly fail in some way it should drop to read only and should appear that way in mount
2012-06-07T05:02:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	i have one ext hd with two partitions
2012-06-07T05:02:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	no you have three different disks. sdb, sdc and sdd
2012-06-07T05:02:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	unless you dont have three disks plugged into this machine?
2012-06-07T05:02:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	what is the sdd? i have two partitions on my internal hd? is the the sdd?
2012-06-07T05:03:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	one of those?
2012-06-07T05:03:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	your mount output lists: /dev/sdb2 on /mnt type ext4 (rw) /dev/sdc2 on /media/backup1010ext4 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks) /dev/sdd2 on /media/backup1010ext4_ type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks)
2012-06-07T05:03:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	that says to me that right now you have THREE different disks in THREE different cases attached to the computer
2012-06-07T05:05:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	what is the sdd2? where did that come from? i only have one backup1010ext4. what is this  /dev/sdd2 on /media/backup1010ext4_ type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks)?
2012-06-07T05:06:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	sdd2 is the second partition on the 4th drive attached to the computer. sda is your first drive (your installed system) sdb is your first (external unless you have multiple internals) drive, sdc the third, and sdd the fourth. if you only have the one external drive then thats our problem. i dont know how you got into this state, but thats the problem
2012-06-07T05:07:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	that is the problem! i only have one ext hd with two partitions attached to this computer. what on earth went haywire? how can i erase this sdd2?
2012-06-07T05:08:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	i would just reboot at this point. and then plug in the disk. eject it in nautilus. remove it. plug it in again, eject it. do that a couple times, and then post the dmesg output
2012-06-07T05:09:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	the kernel is clearly confused about this device so trying to figure it out from the current state will be hard, maybe from a clean reboot something in dmesg will explain what is happening
2012-06-07T05:09:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	 dmesg | tail -n 100 this command?
2012-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	escott	moonpie	yeah but with multiple replugs we may want tail -n 200
2012-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	okie dokie. thanks very much for your help. i hope i dont have to come back.
2012-06-07T05:31:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	if you are still here, i could actually drop a file in the ext hd after restarting it 3x. omg. and the sdd2 vanished! so the kernel just got superconfused. hmmm. just gonna say ive never had a buggier exp with ubuntu than this lts. 10.04 thru 11.04 worked. when i ever i leave the computer more than a day lots of utilities go haywire. i guess my ext hd went haywire and went into the rabbit hole of 12.04.
2012-06-07T05:32:00.000Z	moonpie	escott	really thanks for your help too.
