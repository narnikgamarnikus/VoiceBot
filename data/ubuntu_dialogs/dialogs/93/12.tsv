2011-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	phong_		hi guys, is there winamp for linux?
2011-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	phong_		or any similar type of winamp for linux?
2011-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	phong_		how can i instlal that?
2011-05-31T08:44:00.000Z	phong_		i really want something where it has internet radio
2011-05-31T08:44:00.000Z	phong_		I know winamp for windows has Shoutcast radio
2011-05-31T08:44:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	do you have a link to a shoutcast?.. i'll try to test one.
2011-05-31T08:45:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	why on earth would i have winamp
2011-05-31T08:45:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	because in winamp. i just click on the radio channel
2011-05-31T08:47:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	i just clicked on a station and it worked.
2011-05-31T08:49:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	it's working fien for me
2011-05-31T08:49:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	possible i guess... sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-05-31T08:50:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	198MB to download ;)
2011-05-31T08:50:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	ok.. you should have installed them during install.. to be truthful, but thats irrelevant now.
2011-05-31T08:51:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	is there any good things i need to know more about linux?
2011-05-31T08:52:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	probably plenty, but at this point, they'll fall on deaf ears to you, use the OS, as you encounter problems/concerns, ask questions.
2011-05-31T08:54:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	there might be some minor variations in "how" you do it, but yes, anything you can do in fedora, you can do in ubuntu.
2011-05-31T08:56:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	you can create a sudo user in fedora, but fedora does not use apt-get... it uses YUM...
2011-05-31T08:56:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	than it is different in commands
2011-05-31T08:57:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	did you not pay attention to what i said.. "How you do it, may be different.. but you should be able to do everything in ubuntu, you did in fedora"
2011-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	last question: does fedora has similar type of 'software center' ?
2011-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	if you have questionsa bout fedora, ask in #fedora.. to my knowledge, no it doesn't.
2011-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	thanks . oh well...i like ubuntu
2011-05-31T09:05:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	i can't really play shoutcast..it said i need  an x-shockwave\ flash
2011-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	sudo apt-get install flash-plugin  (I think.. lemme verify that)
2011-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	actually... the version of flash in the repos sucks... so hold on a sec..
2011-05-31T09:07:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	calm down.. go here, and download it...  http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_10.3_for_other_Linux_%28.tar.gz%29
2011-05-31T09:08:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	just go to that link and download that .tar file
2011-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	did you download it.
2011-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	yes i did saved
2011-05-31T09:10:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	go to where ever you downloaded it, and extract it...
2011-05-31T09:10:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	done
2011-05-31T09:10:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	 next?
2011-05-31T09:10:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	now go to the folder you extracted to... and you should see "libflashplayer.so"
2011-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	right click that .so file, and choose copy
2011-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	done, next?
2011-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	now, go to your home folder, and at the top, click "View/Show Hidden Files
2011-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	yeap..next
2011-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	go down to .mozilla and open that folder
2011-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	ok
2011-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	inside .mozilla should be a folder called firefox
2011-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	done
2011-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	now inside .mozilla/firefox   right click, create new folder, and create a folder named "plugins"
2011-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	after you do that.. paste the libflashplayer.so inside the plugins folder
2011-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	done, and plaste insdie that polder?
2011-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	yup
2011-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	then close, and restart firefox
2011-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	why does it work like a charm?
2011-05-31T09:15:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	thanks

2011-05-31T09:23:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	there's ways... to put it in Wine I believe (not sure how successful you'll be)... try to use Linux alternatives (open office, libre office, abiword, gnumeric, etc.)
2011-05-31T09:24:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	sorry i dont drink wine
2011-05-31T09:24:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	what does it has to do with wine

2011-06-05T08:24:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	all i have to do is add blacklist  xxxxxxx 3 lines of codes
2011-06-05T08:25:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	i'll try to figure out the belkin
2011-06-05T08:25:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	can my pc connect 2 usb wirless?

2011-06-05T08:27:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	lol both works now
2011-06-05T08:28:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	that means they likely use the same driver
2011-06-05T08:28:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	u meant i don't need to install driver for each brand ?
2011-06-05T08:28:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	nicely..both are working ;)
2011-06-05T08:33:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	i just want to tell you that i really love ubuntu

2011-06-05T08:36:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	typically...
2011-06-05T08:37:00.000Z	phong_	KM0201	 is it good idea to instal WINE?

2011-06-07T08:50:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	lsusb should show usb devices
2011-06-07T08:52:00.000Z	KM0201	phong_	lsusb
