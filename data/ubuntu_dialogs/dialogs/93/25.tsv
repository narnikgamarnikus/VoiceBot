2009-10-26T17:31:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	you reported a moblin bug?
2009-10-26T17:31:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	moblin or UMR?
2009-10-26T17:31:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I have, but still unresolved. they're all to do with 2.1 though... I tried 2.1 before, but immediately switch back to 2.0
2009-10-26T17:31:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	2.1 is still in development though...
2009-10-26T17:32:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	ubuntu moblin remix have most of the 2.1 components
2009-10-26T17:32:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I tried UMR 3wks ago, but it's very buggy....
2009-10-26T17:32:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	r u using UMR?
2009-10-26T17:32:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	now you won't find a bug

2009-10-26T17:34:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I tested it 3 wks ago, and it kept log me off every now and then...
2009-10-26T17:34:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	that was mutter crashing and now its fixed
2009-10-26T17:35:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	oh great news... do you think they'll release final build of UMR on 28/10 as well?
2009-10-26T17:35:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	have u tried original moblin previously?
2009-10-26T17:35:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	 yes
2009-10-26T17:36:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	installed gstreamer
2009-10-26T17:36:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	installing gstreamer in moblin was hell
2009-10-26T17:36:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I build them with no issue at all
2009-10-26T17:37:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	well, at least most of them... as I still can't play mp4 with audio...
2009-10-26T17:37:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	you compiled them andi used fedora repositories
2009-10-26T17:38:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	how is the boot speed like for UMR?
2009-10-26T17:38:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	boot speed is like karmic
2009-10-26T17:39:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	not so good then...
2009-10-26T17:39:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	but its responsive
2009-10-26T17:39:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	moblin on't give you options to install apps
2009-10-26T17:39:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	i was not even able to instrall deluge
2009-10-26T17:40:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	UI of Moblin but base of Ubuntu makes it great
2009-10-26T17:40:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I install OOO, firefox, mozilla, chromium from moblin though...
2009-10-26T17:41:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	and to me, these applications are enough...
2009-10-26T17:41:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	moblin gave chromium 3.190 in their repo. i used fedora chromium repo for the latest version
2009-10-26T17:41:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	are u still using moblin atm?
2009-10-26T17:41:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	no
2009-10-26T17:41:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	i truly love ubuntu
2009-10-26T17:42:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	he..he... I love ubuntu too... until moblin knocks on my door...
2009-10-26T17:42:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	why can't ubuntu make faster boot just like moblin?
2009-10-26T17:42:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	if you love moblin for boot speed then lucid lynx is coming
2009-10-26T17:42:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	lucid lynx will have 10sec boot
2009-10-26T17:42:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	yeah, i heard about that...
2009-10-26T17:42:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	but somehow I doubt...
2009-10-26T17:43:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	its ubuntu you don't have to doubt
2009-10-26T17:44:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	one reason i left moblin was that it don't have initrd and i required it for faster boot
2009-10-26T17:45:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	my aspire one SSD is  so slow and you can only install moblin on its ssd
2009-10-26T17:45:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	when I installed UMR 3 wks ago, the newly installed application icon was not shown in the application list
2009-10-26T17:45:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	how come?
2009-10-26T17:46:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	i reported that and it got fixed
2009-10-26T17:46:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	that's good...
2009-10-26T17:47:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-moblin-remix/+bug/433469
2009-10-26T17:47:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	so 3G is working on UMR now?
2009-10-26T17:48:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	i don't have 3g to test
2009-10-26T17:48:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	but no body reported such bug so might no exist
2009-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	well, it works well in karmic beta, so it should be also working in UMR, right?
2009-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	i filed bug for moblin 2.0 and got response after 5days
2009-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	yes, same with me....
2009-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	moblin uses connman
2009-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	not the gnome network manager
2009-10-26T17:49:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	do you manage to get facebook feed from mojito?
2009-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	no. i dont use facebook
2009-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	yeah, I know about that connman stuff... intel's thing, right?
2009-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	i think 3g will work
2009-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	UMR uses moblin 2.1 apps so connman here now shows blutooth wired wireless 3g etc
2009-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	so can we choose connman or networkmanager in UMR?
2009-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	no
2009-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	so, which one does UMR use?
2009-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	although i installed network manager for use in gnome-session
2009-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	connman
2009-10-26T17:53:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	and dalston as power manager
2009-10-26T17:54:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I really like moblin UI, but also ubuntu's popularity (with deb package), so if UMR is stable enough, I might download it
2009-10-26T17:54:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	if you open this page you will see that many bug are fixed many
2009-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	wow... that's promising...
2009-10-26T17:57:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	the last time I check, moblin still have a lot of bug to be fixed... well, sometime it won't be fixed anyway... the status just changed to "WONTFIX"... which is suck
2009-10-26T17:58:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	there is only one won't fix and that's upstream
2009-10-26T17:58:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	so UMR still use deb right? not rpm?
2009-10-26T18:02:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	are you using chromium with plugins now?
2009-10-26T18:12:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	thanks a lot for your respond... now, i'm downloading UMR daily feed from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-moblin-remix/daily-live/20091024/
2009-10-26T18:13:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	yes its fine cd
2009-10-26T18:13:00.000Z	hylman	om26er	I believe this is more advance build than moblin rc
2009-10-26T18:13:00.000Z	om26er	hylman	some high prority bugs were fixed after RC so they made a new cd
