2005-11-08T06:39:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	mv <source> <destination>
2005-11-08T07:14:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	use the .inf file
2005-11-08T07:22:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	for a wep setup, sudo iwconfig wlan0 ESSID <access point> key encrypted s:<password> or <passkey>
2005-11-08T07:24:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	the driver module isn't loaded
2005-11-08T08:18:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what does ndiswrapper -l show you?
2005-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	, all invalid drivers
2005-11-08T08:19:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	type ndiswrapper -i <filename>.inf
2005-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	when i do that, it says the driver is already installed
2005-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	then that driver doesn't work with ndiswrapper for your card, what's the driver name?
2005-11-08T08:23:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	is that the latest version of the drivers?
2005-11-08T08:24:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	you have to get ndiswrapper reporting driver present, hardware present first
2005-11-08T08:25:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what's the make and model of your wifi device?
2005-11-08T08:25:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	: it's Linksys WUSB54G Wireless USB Adapter
2005-11-08T08:25:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what does lsusb show you?

2005-11-08T08:26:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	lsusb
2005-11-08T08:28:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	can you paste them in #flood?
2005-11-08T08:29:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	unplug the device and then lsusb again, that will indicate wich line shows your device
2005-11-08T08:30:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what does it say?
2005-11-08T08:31:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	sorry, was premature there
2005-11-08T08:32:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	have you a folder with all the files in including a .inf file?
2005-11-08T08:33:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what's the .inf file?
2005-11-08T08:36:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	are u there?
2005-11-08T08:36:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	apparently there's a WUSB54Gv4 which is a different chip from the previous 3 versions
2005-11-08T08:37:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	try an earlier driver
2005-11-08T08:38:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	in that case, download the latest from the website and try those
2005-11-08T08:38:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	ndiswrapper -i does that
2005-11-08T08:39:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	you mean all the drivers or all the files on the cd?
2005-11-08T08:40:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	download latest version from linksys website
2005-11-08T08:41:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	it's ndiswrapper -i <filename.inf> to install driver then ndiswrapper -l to check if it's loaded
2005-11-08T08:43:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	then download latest winxp drivers from linksys and see if they work
2005-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what's the model number on your device?
2005-11-08T08:45:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	doesn't give a version number?
2005-11-08T08:46:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	on the actual device itselft?
2005-11-08T08:46:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	yes, will be listed near the serial number, for a guess
2005-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	ok, looking on web
2005-11-08T08:50:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	i found this site, any help? http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/archive/41/2005/05/2/320897
2005-11-08T08:53:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	problem not solved on that thread, I've found another though.. try this one http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List and scroll down
2005-11-08T08:54:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	on the cd, in the ver 4 folder, there is rt2500usb.inf, rt2500usb.sys and WUSB5GV4.cat
2005-11-08T08:55:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	copy them all to a folder in your /home
2005-11-08T08:57:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	then type sudo ndiswrapper -i ~/<folder>/rt2500usb.inf
2005-11-08T09:00:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	I can't remember the option to remove an installed driver, type ndiswrapper --help and tell me what it says
2005-11-08T09:01:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	sudo ndiswrapper -e rt2500usb.inf
2005-11-08T09:01:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	then type sudo ndiswrapper -i ~/<folder>/rt2500usb.inf
2005-11-08T09:04:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	this is weird, when i go to delete the drivers, it says they aren't installed
2005-11-08T09:05:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	did you run both commands?
2005-11-08T09:05:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	sudo ndiswrapper -e rt2500usb.inf
2005-11-08T09:05:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	then type sudo ndiswrapper -i ~/<folder>/rt2500usb.inf
2005-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	do those and tell me what ndiswrapper -l says
2005-11-08T09:07:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	ok, I've found an alternative ;) https://wiki.ubuntu.com//Rt2500WirelessCardsHowTo/
2005-11-08T09:09:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	thanks for trying so hard, i have to go now
2005-11-08T12:49:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	type modprobe ndiswrapper
2005-11-08T12:49:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	i reinstalled ndiswrapper to get a fresh start
2005-11-08T12:50:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	if installed correctly the drivers will be copied to /etc/ndiswrapper and ndiswrapper -l will list them
2005-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	type ndswrapper -i rt2500usb.inf
2005-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	that should copy them to /etc/ndiswrapper
2005-11-08T12:53:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	it says driver installed, now what should i do?
2005-11-08T12:54:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	now you iwconfig
2005-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	what about sudo ndiswrapper modprobe?
2005-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	sorry, thought you'd done that
2005-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	then ndiswrapper -m
2005-11-08T12:56:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	that last bit will make the module load when your system boots
2005-11-08T12:57:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	when i type in ndiswrapper -m, it says modprobe already contains alias directive
2005-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	ok
2005-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	thank you soo much for all of your help today and last night, it works now :)
2005-11-08T12:58:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	congratulations :)
2005-11-08T12:59:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	well done for sticking with it
2005-11-08T13:01:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	thank you soo much for all of your help today and last night, it works now :)
2005-11-08T13:38:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	when i go to System--->Administration--->Network, my network device wlan0 appears, i enter the security code, and the network, then i hit ok, it activates it, but it's not going on the internet
2005-11-08T13:38:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	does ifconfig wlan0 show you an inet address?
2005-11-08T13:40:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	ping ubuntu.com
2005-11-08T13:40:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	ctrl-c to stop it pinging
2005-11-08T13:40:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	how?
2005-11-08T13:40:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	in a terminal type ping ubuntu.com
2005-11-08T13:42:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	what is your inet address under wlan0?
2005-11-08T13:43:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	and erUSUL, it works when i ping 82.211.81.130
2005-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	it says 75 packets recived 75 packets transmitted when i did the ping
2005-11-08T13:46:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	that's good, do you use dhcp?
2005-11-08T13:49:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	is your wlan0 configured with dhcp or static?
2005-11-08T13:49:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	what do u think is wrong? (or what should i do, because the ping works)
2005-11-08T13:49:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	so you can't set the dns server?
2005-11-08T13:51:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	add the address of your access point in there
2005-11-08T13:51:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	in the general tab, under Domain Name, should there be anything in there?
2005-11-08T13:52:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	I don't think that matters
2005-11-08T13:53:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	no, you don't need anything there, just the access point's address in DNS Servers
2005-11-08T13:54:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	just make sure your access points address is in the DNS Servers box
2005-11-08T13:55:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	your wireless router
2005-11-08T13:55:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	is there any addresses under DNS Servers?
2005-11-08T13:56:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	can you log into your wireless router from your other computer to controll it?
2005-11-08T13:58:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	you can find the access point's numeric ip address then?
2005-11-08T14:01:00.000Z	cianci	anto9us	i am online!!
2005-11-08T14:01:00.000Z	anto9us	cianci	woohoo!
