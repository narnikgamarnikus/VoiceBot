2009-12-11T16:08:00.000Z	indus	VirusTB	in live cd , it will not show any such things, HDD Is not involved at all
2009-12-11T16:08:00.000Z	indus	VirusTB	anyways, if you cant boot windows, you will have to fixmbr with windowscd
2009-12-11T16:09:00.000Z	indus	VirusTB	so how are you booting unr?
2009-12-11T16:09:00.000Z	indus	VirusTB	no cd rom? then? usb?
