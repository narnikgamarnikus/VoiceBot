2010-08-19T19:22:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	So they have different size and you don't use compiz?
2010-08-19T19:23:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	the 3D Gimmick Desktop. What happens if you do <ctrl><alt>arrow right?
2010-08-19T19:24:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	it changes virtual desktop
2010-08-19T19:24:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	do you get a smoll window that indicates the change or a big transparent one?
2010-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	a small transparent rectangle
2010-08-19T19:26:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	not all at the same time...
2010-08-19T19:27:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	COUld you just start with one screen first, before we plug the 2nd. That would help us.
2010-08-19T19:33:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	with only 1 screen, i can play a video, but with 2 monitors, the videos are black or grey
2010-08-19T19:33:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	So. With one screen, for you everything seems ok? Is that true?
2010-08-19T19:35:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	ok. Do you use any driver of the ->system->administration->HArdware Dirver for your Graphics CArd?
2010-08-19T19:35:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	checking
2010-08-19T19:36:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	no proprietary drivers are in use on this system
2010-08-19T19:36:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Ok. That's not so bad, as everything should be handled by the system.
2010-08-19T19:36:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	it's a macbook
2010-08-19T19:38:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Now I want you to go to go to ->system->preferences->Appearence in the 'Visual Efects TAb' Select 'None' there.
2010-08-19T19:39:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	was already on none
2010-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	ok. now. PLug the 2nd monitor and go to ->system->preferences->monitors
2010-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i see a vague 1 line animation on 1st line of the big monitor when i try to play a video
2010-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	im there
2010-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	We are not yet there...
2010-08-19T19:41:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Do you see both monitors in there now?
2010-08-19T19:42:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	NOw configure both monitors. First do 'detect monitors'. You can also choose the position with drag&drop on a monitor
2010-08-19T19:42:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i already done that
2010-08-19T19:43:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Ok. SO you have both monitors in front of you and on one of them there is a panel, but not on the other?
2010-08-19T19:44:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	What software are you using?
2010-08-19T19:44:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	yes, the small monitor has the panel, the big monitor has only windows
2010-08-19T19:45:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i can't play video with any player, each of that works when only 1 monitor is active
2010-08-19T19:46:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	This was a laptop right? What monitor is configured as main monitor?
2010-08-19T19:48:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	the laptop's monitor has the taskbars
2010-08-19T19:50:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Your problem seems to be hardware related. Check glxinfo and glxgears (sudo apt-get install mesa-utils).
2010-08-19T19:51:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	CAn you give me your exact type of MacBook?
2010-08-19T19:52:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	a white macbook from 2007
2010-08-19T19:53:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	what should i do with glxinfo and glxgears
2010-08-19T19:53:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	They are almost all white... ;) Is that the small tiny version?
2010-08-19T19:54:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Check if you have direct rendering with both screens activated.
2010-08-19T19:54:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i have 3300 fps on both screens
2010-08-19T19:55:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	That's ok.
2010-08-19T19:55:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	when i play a flash video on a website, it works
2010-08-19T19:56:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	it just doesnt work when i try to play a local video file
2010-08-19T19:56:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	and your sound problem is only related to local media too, or also for flash video?
2010-08-19T19:57:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i have sound from the laptop itself but when i plug then jack for speakers, the sound is off even tho the speakers are on and with volume
2010-08-19T19:59:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	For the speaker. Go to the volume-applet on the panel and click on it. ->sound preferences 'OUtput'-TAB -> 'Connector'=Analog Headphones. Try that.
2010-08-20T00:07:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i don't have sound at all now
2010-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Did we talk before? I don't remember...
2010-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	to fix the sound output on lucid lynx on a macbook, didn't make sound when speakers are plugged
2010-08-20T00:10:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	now i don't even have sound at all
2010-08-20T00:11:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i can get sound from the laptop, but not from speakers plugged in the headphones hub
2010-08-20T00:11:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	I remeber now... Put the 'Connector' back to 'Analog Output' That should give you the sound back.
2010-08-20T00:11:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i do that, but it doesn't fix it
2010-08-20T00:12:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	My guess was, that if you change the connector to Analog Headphones, that it would cut the speakers and redirect sound to the Headphone (other speaker)
2010-08-20T00:13:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	only with "analog speakers" i have sound, with "analog output", i don't have sound at all, even trying all 7 sound profiles in the hardware tab
2010-08-20T00:14:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Check alsamixer in a console and verify, that the volume settings are correct for 'Headphones'
2010-08-20T00:16:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	alsamixer doesn't show a headphones tab
2010-08-20T00:17:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	That is not a good sign. Looks that alsa is not recognizing your card correclty. Did we do a 'lspci | grep Audio'? The output could give you a start for tracking the bug.

2010-08-20T00:22:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i guess i can survive with sound from laptop. in the meantime, i still didn't fix the video problem when 2 monitors are plugged

2010-08-20T00:25:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	If I remember correctly. You can play a youtube flash file on both of the Monitors, but no local video, right? Did you try alternate software like vlc or mplayer?
2010-08-20T00:33:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	re, i installed the backends and gnome alsa mixer and it fixed it :) i had to put up the speaker slider.
2010-08-20T00:33:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Nice ;)
2010-08-20T00:34:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	If I remember correctly. You can play a youtube flash file on both of the Monitors, but no local video, right? Did you try alternate software like vlc or mplayer?
2010-08-20T00:34:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	yes, that is correct. no matter the player, it shows a black video in window or grey video in fullscreen, with the sound playing normally
2010-08-20T00:35:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	and you tried totem and vlc?
2010-08-20T00:36:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	yes, same result with any player
2010-08-20T00:37:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	That is really strange. I have a ATI 9600 in Dual mode here and a Nvidia 7600GS (Dual too) I never had that kind of problems... Also if I remember well 'Direct Rendering' is working ok, right?
2010-08-20T00:38:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	how do i check that? glx gears are working at 3.5jfps
2010-08-20T00:38:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	how do i check that? glx gears are working at 3.5kfps
2010-08-20T00:38:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Hehe... 3,5fs? So no direct rendering. Check the output of glxinfo
2010-08-20T00:39:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Ok. Direct rendering is working ;)
2010-08-20T00:40:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	That is really strange and goes beyond my experience.

2010-08-20T00:46:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i don't think that will help me, the monitors have very different resolutions
2010-08-20T00:46:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	I guess you have to do some further investigation. The so called x-edgers ppa is maybe a solution, but I never used that with Intel. https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
2010-08-20T00:47:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	I can only recommend that, if you know what you are doing.
2010-08-20T00:48:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	thank you
2010-08-20T00:49:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	no problem
2010-08-20T00:59:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	re
2010-08-20T00:59:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	with resolution of 1024x768 on both screens, i have video working on both screens
2010-08-20T01:00:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	only when i put higher resolution on the big screen , the video turns black
2010-08-20T01:00:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i can even play fullscreen
2010-08-20T01:01:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Ok. So you card may have a maximal output resolution, I guess.
2010-08-20T01:01:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	but it works with no problem in macosx
2010-08-20T01:02:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	Ask the Intel gurus on the channel. I am more ATI ;) This is a driver thing...
2010-08-20T01:04:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	 :)
2010-08-20T01:07:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	The coolest thing would be to install e17 as window manager, because that would give you to totally indipendant screens ;) This way, you will have to create your own background with the exact size of the two screens.
2010-08-20T01:08:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	i think i need gnome to get the airport working
2010-08-20T01:09:00.000Z	KomiaPoika	minimec	what package installs e17?
2010-08-20T01:10:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	it's not in the official repository.
2010-08-20T01:12:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	http://packages.enlightenment.org/  --> deb http://packages.enlightenment.org/ubuntu lucid main extras in /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-08-20T01:13:00.000Z	minimec	KomiaPoika	You can use the gnome settings in e17 (loading gnome-settings-deamon and nm-applet at the beginning of a session)
