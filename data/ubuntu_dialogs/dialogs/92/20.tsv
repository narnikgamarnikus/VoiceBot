2010-05-01T17:23:00.000Z	caac		which update option should i use? "normal releases" or "lts"?
2010-05-01T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	caac	do you want normal releases or just LTS releases?
2010-05-01T17:25:00.000Z	caac	jrib	well, i'm not quite sure, if i plan to update to 10.10 asap then i'll need normal releases i guess?
2010-05-01T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	caac	yes, normal
2010-06-03T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	caac	copy over ~otheraccount/.* ?
2010-06-03T15:28:00.000Z	caac	jrib	sorry I don't understand what you're saying, I have 1 account atm, I just want another name for it, but that's impossible, so I'll make a new one, but I'd like it to have all the programs I currently have, and if possible my documents too
2010-06-03T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	caac	ok, do this then... copy /home/otheraccount to /home/newaccount
2010-06-03T15:30:00.000Z	caac	jrib	how do I make a new account? ><
2010-06-03T15:30:00.000Z	jrib	caac	system -> administration -> users and groups
2010-06-03T15:33:00.000Z	caac	jrib	I made a new account, now what?
2010-06-03T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	caac	do what I said?
2010-06-03T15:33:00.000Z	caac	jrib	but the new account says it's a desktop user, but my current one is a custom one
2010-06-03T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	caac	you should give the new account admin rights
2010-06-03T15:35:00.000Z	caac	jrib	done, is that the root now?
2010-06-03T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	caac	no.  It has sudo privileges
2010-06-03T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	caac	ok, do this then... copy /home/otheraccount to /home/newaccount
2010-06-03T15:36:00.000Z	caac	jrib	do i need to close all the opened programs in order to get that command to work?
2010-06-03T15:38:00.000Z	caac	jrib	i can't find the new account
2010-06-03T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	caac	where are you looking?
2010-06-03T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	caac	no, look in /home
2010-06-03T15:40:00.000Z	caac	jrib	if i do ctrl-h i get folders of programs i have installed, do i need to copy those too?
2010-06-03T15:40:00.000Z	jrib	caac	yeah
2010-06-03T15:41:00.000Z	jrib	caac	after you copy them, you'll need to modify ownership
2010-06-03T15:41:00.000Z	caac	jrib	i can copy, but not paste
2010-06-03T15:42:00.000Z	jrib	caac	right, you'll have to do it as superuser.  You can do: gksudo nautilus
2010-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	caac	jrib	i got an error from chromium
2010-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	caac	what error?
2010-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	caac	jrib	"SingletonSocket"
2010-06-03T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	caac	why are you running chromium?  Are you running it as the old user?  The new user?  Did you modify the ownership rights for the files you copied already?
2010-06-03T15:46:00.000Z	caac	jrib	i'm running chromium to listen to music
2010-06-03T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	caac	I asked more than one question :/
2010-06-03T15:47:00.000Z	caac	jrib	i'm running it as the old user, didn't modify anything so far
2010-06-03T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	caac	don't know about chromium
2010-06-03T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	caac	if you want
2010-06-03T15:48:00.000Z	caac	jrib	it asks me: A file named ".bash_logout" already exists.  Do you want to replace it?
2010-06-03T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	caac	doesn't matter, they should be the same anyway
2010-06-03T15:49:00.000Z	caac	jrib	now i'll log out from my old and log in my new one?
2010-06-03T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	caac	no, update the ownership first
2010-06-03T15:50:00.000Z	caac	jrib	how do i do that?
2010-06-03T15:51:00.000Z	jrib	caac	sudo chown -R NAME_OF_NEW_USER_GOES_HERE: /home/NAME_OF_NEW_USER_GOES_HERE
2010-06-03T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	caac	yes, and all of the characters around it exactly
2010-06-03T15:53:00.000Z	caac	jrib	it didn't give me any output, that good?
2010-06-03T15:53:00.000Z	jrib	caac	yes, no output is always good.  Linux will only tell you when something goes wrong
2010-06-03T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	caac	sure
2010-06-03T15:58:00.000Z	caac	jrib	may I remove the old account now?
2010-06-03T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	caac	I'd keep it around for a couple of days just in case
2010-06-03T16:00:00.000Z	caac	jrib	it's not a big deal, but all the icons of my folders in the sidebar of nautilus are the same, can i change them back to their original ones?
2010-06-03T16:02:00.000Z	caac	jrib	oh-oh, I found a bug I think, my globalmenubar gives me the documents folder from my old acc instead of my new one
2010-06-03T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	caac	that's probably just because the setting had your old user explicitly.  You'll have to reset that when you come across it
2010-06-03T16:04:00.000Z	caac	jrib	where do i come across it? :S
2010-06-03T16:11:00.000Z	caac	jrib	when i log back in my new acc, it logs me in, but then says my keyring pass was wrong, and then i have to enter the old pass again
2010-06-03T17:52:00.000Z	caac	jrib	I've been able to solve all my issues I had with the new account except for one; when I'm logged in, it first prompts me to enter the old password again
2010-06-03T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	caac	with your keyring?
2010-06-03T17:53:00.000Z	caac	jrib	yeah!
2010-06-03T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	caac	there should be a program that allows you to manage your keyring in either the Accessories menu or the System menu
2010-06-03T17:56:00.000Z	caac	jrib	sorry but I can't find it ><
2010-06-03T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	caac	I'm not in gnome atm so can't tell you exactly where it is
2010-06-04T01:50:00.000Z	caac	jrib	are you on Gnome atm?
2010-06-04T01:50:00.000Z	jrib	caac	no
2010-06-04T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	caac	why?
2010-06-04T01:51:00.000Z	caac	jrib	remember the keyring problem?
2010-06-04T01:52:00.000Z	jrib	caac	oh, you haven't found the program yet?
2010-06-04T01:52:00.000Z	caac	jrib	yeah exactly
2010-06-04T01:52:00.000Z	jrib	caac	hold on, I'll log into gnome
2010-06-04T01:54:00.000Z	jrib	caac	Accessories -> Passwords and Encryption Keys
2010-06-04T01:54:00.000Z	caac	jrib	I looked there, can't find it ><
2010-06-04T01:55:00.000Z	jrib	caac	do you have anything listed there?
2010-06-04T01:55:00.000Z	caac	jrib	under the Passwords tab?
2010-06-04T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	caac	isn't there something like a "keyring" tab?
2010-06-04T01:56:00.000Z	caac	jrib	Passwords, My personal keys, Other keys
2010-06-04T01:57:00.000Z	jrib	caac	well is there anything in any of them?
2010-06-04T01:58:00.000Z	caac	jrib	under the tab Passwords, there's a folder Passwords, I expand that, and get 5 things
2010-06-04T01:58:00.000Z	jrib	caac	it's probably this
2010-06-04T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	caac	going to get some dinner
2010-06-04T02:00:00.000Z	caac	jrib	bon appetit
2010-06-05T15:59:00.000Z	caac	jrib	are you on Gnome?
2010-06-05T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	caac	I'm never on gnome, just ask though :)
2010-06-05T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	caac	oh.  Describe exactly when you get asked for it and ask the channel, someone may know
2010-06-05T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	caac	you can't right click on "Passwords: login" and select "change password"?
2010-06-05T16:11:00.000Z	caac	jrib	sweet!!!! that works
2010-07-09T01:58:00.000Z	jrib	caac	and update ownership of files, yeah
2010-07-09T01:59:00.000Z	caac	jrib	I remember you, you helped me last time :D
2010-07-09T01:59:00.000Z	jrib	caac	chown -R $USER: ~
2010-07-09T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	caac	don't do that in the wrong place, or it will mess up your system :)
2010-07-09T02:00:00.000Z	caac	jrib	may i pm u real qucik?
2010-07-09T02:01:00.000Z	jrib	caac	easier to stay in the channel, and that way others can help too
2010-07-09T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	caac	the syntax is: chown USERNAME:GROUP PATH.  Or if the username and the group is the same, you can use the shorthand: chown USERNAME: PATH.  And if you want it to be recursive, you use -R
2010-07-09T02:04:00.000Z	jrib	caac	you don't tell it the old username, you just tell it the new USERNAME you want the file to belong to
2010-07-09T02:05:00.000Z	jrib	caac	well, you need the path at the end
2010-07-09T02:09:00.000Z	caac	jrib	when I have copied everything over to the new username folder, I open a terminal and type in "chown -R /home/newusername"?
2010-07-09T02:09:00.000Z	jrib	caac	chown -R newusername: /home/newusername
2010-07-09T02:11:00.000Z	caac	jrib	does it require a sudo?
