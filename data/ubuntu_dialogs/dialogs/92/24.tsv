2010-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	|jonathan|		becoz the modem is not responding
2010-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Is this a USB 3g modem?
2010-07-15T10:42:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	no usb edge modem
2010-07-15T10:43:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	If you have a term open, and you run "wvdialconf" => does it find or configure the modem?
2010-07-15T10:44:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	i did that and it says tht the modem is not responding
2010-07-15T10:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Remove the modem, delete the /etc/wvdial.conf that was created => check the /etc/modules.d/blacklist.conf to see if the module for that USB modem is being "blacklisted" -> you can also plug it in, then wait a tick, click System => Administration => Hardware Drivers => see if that picks up the modem/driver/module...
2010-07-15T10:47:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	okk wait
2010-07-15T10:49:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Is that the actual model of the modem? You sure it's not like a Huwei or similar?
2010-07-15T10:49:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	yah its the actual modem
2010-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	my problem is my modem is not responding ..what might be the reason for this...
2010-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Found one...from 2007...

2010-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	my modem is a usb modem and its a plug and play device
2010-07-15T10:52:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Yes. This is understood. Ahem. Meanwhile, did you download/install usb-modeswitch and run that yet?
2010-07-15T10:52:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	no whats that
2010-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Install usb-modeswitch. Firstly. After that is installed, try using lsusb to make sure the modem is showing up. After that, re-try using wvdialconf to generate a dialing configuration for this modem.
2010-07-15T10:54:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	how can i install usb-modeswithch .. i dont hav internet in ubuntu u know
2010-07-15T10:55:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Download it on the machine that you're on. Transfer it then to the machine you want to run it on. Easy.

2010-07-15T10:56:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/usb-modeswitch
2010-07-15T10:56:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	allright

2010-07-15T11:00:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	[usb-modeswitch_1.1.0-2.debian.tar.gz]
2010-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Um...now ya lost me...I'm not seeing any .tar.gz on this page...( http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/i386/usb-modeswitch/download )
2010-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	okk
2010-07-15T11:02:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Lower left side of original page, link to either the amd64 or i386 .DEB packages.
2010-07-15T11:02:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	i use 32 bit pc
2010-07-15T11:02:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Is there no other means by which to connect the machine that you're using the USB modem with to the net?
2010-07-15T11:03:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Well, then you'll be downloading the i386 version matey
2010-07-15T11:03:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	no other way :(
2010-07-15T11:05:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Vodafone does not make modems - they're a telco mate. They BUY them from the makers...like Philips and Huwei and the likes...
2010-07-15T11:05:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	so my modem is philips?
2010-07-15T11:05:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	bingo mate.
2010-07-15T11:08:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Nothing to be confused about. Just get the usb-modeswitch .DEB, copy it to the other machine, install it, then re-run the wvdialconf program.
2010-07-15T11:09:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	can u gimme a link where i click and it will start downloading plz

2010-07-15T11:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	http://ftp.iinet.net.au/pub/ubuntu/pool/universe/u/usb-modeswitch/usb-modeswitch_1.1.0-2_i386.deb
2010-07-15T11:11:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	downloaded mate what should i do now
2010-07-15T11:11:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Copy it to the machine you need it on. Then install it. Then, as root (or use sudo), run it.
2010-07-15T11:11:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	tell me how to install it :P
2010-07-15T11:12:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	double-click it.
2010-07-15T11:12:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	dowble click will install it? then what to do after installation
2010-07-15T11:13:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	As I said, install it. In a terminal, then run (as root or with sudo) usb-modeswitch and after that, you run wvdialconf again to re-generate the /etc/wvdial.conf => see if that wakes the modem up and makes wvdial access it properly.
2010-07-15T11:14:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	how to install it in terminal :P
2010-07-15T11:14:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	what should i type in terminal to install it
2010-07-15T11:15:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	dpkg -i PACKAGENAME.deb
2010-07-15T11:21:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	im gonna do that wait

2010-07-15T11:21:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	It's early. I'm not going anywhere yet.
2010-07-15T11:59:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	hey the main problem is when i type wvdialconf it says that my modem is not detected
2010-07-15T12:07:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Wassup...
2010-07-15T12:08:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	f..uped

2010-07-15T12:08:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	so what we have to do is how to detect the modem in ubuntu
2010-07-15T12:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Did you follow the steps that I already gave you, or are you going to make me type them again?
2010-07-15T12:10:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	i double clicket the .deb
2010-07-15T12:11:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	You've lost me on the last statement.

2010-07-15T12:15:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	If nothing is working, next step is to download and install this: https://forge.betavine.net/frs/?group_id=12
2010-07-15T12:15:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	whats this
2010-07-15T12:16:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	It's a project called "Vodafone Mobile Connect" - it's a standalone GUI for dealing with USB modems - and for troublesome ones, at that.
2010-07-15T12:16:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	which one should i download

2010-07-15T12:20:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Um...what do you think you'd do after you install it...hmm?? Possibly run it? See what it does? See if it recognises your modem ?? :)
2010-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Is it working yet?
2010-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	proudly not :D

2010-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Read the following page CAREFULLY. http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/
2010-07-15T13:16:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	Serial ports do not detect USB's mate. They're two different animals.
2010-07-15T13:16:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	then why my modem is not detected by my ubuntu..
2010-07-15T13:17:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	|jonathan|	There are several reasons why it might NOT be detected - bad design of the hardware is one...
2010-07-15T13:18:00.000Z	|jonathan|	YankDownUnder	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Poblem very mus poblem
