2009-09-11T21:29:00.000Z	Halitech	racha	don't blame Ubuntu because something doesn't work properly, blame the hardware manufactorers for not releasing drivers or specs so we can create drivers that work properly

2009-09-11T21:48:00.000Z	Halitech	racha	most times the devs are working on getting basic functionality so depending on who is working on the driver for this card, getting 5.1 to work may not be a priority for them ... you could try playing around with the mixer settings and see if there is any settings there that might help
2009-09-11T22:02:00.000Z	Halitech	racha	no, its just different then windows
