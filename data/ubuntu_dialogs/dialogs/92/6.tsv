2011-12-22T06:17:00.000Z	vouth		Whenever I try to build something, I get: "error: C compiler cannot create executables", and the log says "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc". What's happening here?
2011-12-22T06:17:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	hmm.. the linker is missing something
2011-12-22T06:18:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I've installed all the common tools etc I thought I'd need. Is there an easy way to tell what's missing?
2011-12-22T06:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	a quick loko at the man page says you may be misisng /lib/crt0.o
2011-12-22T06:18:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	(Sorry, I know next to nothing about development) Ok, I'll look and see if it's there…
2011-12-22T06:19:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	so, lets back track, when you say build something, is this you compiling from source? or any c program
2011-12-22T06:19:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Well I definitely don't have that file there.
2011-12-22T06:19:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	It's Mesa (the graphics library)
2011-12-22T06:19:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	ok I think your actually missing libc.a
2011-12-22T06:20:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I'm hoping the newer version (that isn't in the 10.10 repos) will support the graphics chipset I have
2011-12-22T06:20:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	run this: sudo find / -name "libc.a"
2011-12-22T06:24:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Not done searching yet but: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/xen/libc.a, /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.a
2011-12-22T06:25:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	ok so you have the package, but it could be that libc.a is not in ld's search path
2011-12-22T06:26:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	that last was to you. It turned out to be sort of… reflexive. D'oh! :-S
2011-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	wha?
2011-12-22T06:27:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	lol, I accidentally addressed a message to myself :-P  It looks like I have to edit /etc/ld.so.conf then.
2011-12-22T06:28:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	(I'm looking at http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/notes/rpath.html)
2011-12-22T06:28:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	you can probably pass the extra variable you need to the make process
2011-12-22T06:36:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Oh, hmm.
2011-12-22T06:36:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I have no idea how to do that. :-P All I'm doing is running ./configure :-D
2011-12-22T06:37:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	OHHH so your not even making the driver yet
2011-12-22T06:37:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Nope, didn't even get that far! :-P
2011-12-22T06:38:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	do you have libc6-dev installed?
2011-12-22T06:42:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Yes, I do have libc6-dev installed.
2011-12-22T06:42:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	look at the configure file, see where or how its looking for libc.a
2011-12-22T06:43:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I tried adding a line /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/xen/ to /etc/ld.so.conf and then running ldconfig but I got the same error.
2011-12-22T06:43:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	just to make sure.. are you a 64 or 32bit OS?
2011-12-22T06:43:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	32bit
2011-12-22T06:44:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	the other line in /etc/ld.so.conf is include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf.
2011-12-22T06:44:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	IN that folder are GL.conf@  i686-linux-gnu.conf  libasound2.conf  libc.conf
2011-12-22T06:49:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	In GL.conf is /usr/lib/fglrx. In i686-linux-gnu.conf http://wklej.se/5640 In libasound2.conf is /usr/lib/alsa-lib. In libc.conf are 2 lines: "# libc default configuration" and "/usr/local/lib"
2011-12-22T07:06:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I tried adding the path to the folder containing one of those libc.a files to libc.conf and then running sudo ldconfig, but it still didn't work. Here's my complete config.log: http://wklej.se/af18
2011-12-22T07:08:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	hmm.. can you check gcc's search path? maybe thats the issue
2011-12-22T07:17:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	How can I check that search path?
2011-12-22T07:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	theres some command in gcc.. I think its.. —print-search-directories? it should be in the -h output or in the man page
2011-12-22T07:23:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	It's --print-search-dirs. :-) No idea what to make of the output though!! http://wklej.se/ef63
2011-12-22T07:24:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	thats basically where all the components of the build process looks for things like libraries and stuff
2011-12-22T07:25:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	is libc.a in any of those i686 dirs?
2011-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Yup there's one in /usr/lib/i686-linux-gnu/
2011-12-22T07:27:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Not right under but it's /usr/lib/i686-linux-gnu/xen/libc.a
2011-12-22T07:28:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	ok, I forget, is that 686 directory in gcc's search path?
2011-12-22T07:29:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	yup
2011-12-22T07:29:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	that is weird.. lets try this… do you know how to write C programs?
2011-12-22T07:30:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	nope, no idea. Only PHP and VB.Net (sorry but it's true :-D)!
2011-12-22T07:30:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	im gonna write you a quick C program, I want you to test somethin for me
2011-12-22T07:31:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	And I wouldn't even trust myself with those languages :-P
2011-12-22T07:31:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Cool, thanks! Just as long as it doesn't format my hard disk or something :-D
2011-12-22T07:31:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	copy this into some file called whatever.c, http://pastebin.com/t650aVNy
2011-12-22T07:31:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	oh ofcourse not
2011-12-22T07:32:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	do you have it copied?
2011-12-22T07:34:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	hehe, I was just joking. Well no actually. I'm still waiting for a browser to open — Banshee's eating up all my cpu and ram with an import :-D
2011-12-22T07:36:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Dam this is taking a long time!! Sorry! :-S
2011-12-22T07:37:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	its cool brah
2011-12-22T07:40:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	done: ~/yougotthatrightyo.c
2011-12-22T07:40:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	ok, now run gcc -o fubar yougotthatrightyo.c
2011-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
2011-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	man.. there is something WEIRD with your system
2011-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	(that was on two lines, the second beginning at 'collect2')
2011-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I hate when that happens. It seems to happen a *lot*. :-(
2011-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	I have NEVER seen that happen before
2011-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	just totally random weird sh!t.
2011-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	have you tried reinstalling gcc and build-essential?
2011-12-22T07:42:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	No idea why. Maybe I should uninstall and then reinstall gcc etc?
2011-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	hehe, great minds think alike :-D
2011-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	no I have not.
2011-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I guess that's next, so here goes!
2011-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	the next thing I would try would be to, instead of using gcc, to build that c file one at a time. Basically: preprocessor, compiler, assembler, linker
2011-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	before or after the reinstalls?
2011-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	after if you still cant compile my file
2011-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	ok
2011-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	my guess is that the pp, compiler, and assembler shouldnt fail.. but the linker will.. so we may not get anymore info
2011-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Ah. That makes sense. The reinstalls might take a while; removing gcc took VirtualBox along with it :-P
2011-12-22T07:46:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	oh noez
2011-12-22T07:48:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	lol, howsabout I try to get audio working in the meantime??? :-D
2011-12-22T07:49:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	oh God.. sound is the only thing I hate worse than X Server
2011-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Hmm, well I think my problem is that I don't have a sound card. That might explain it…
2011-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	that wuld be a good freakin guess
2011-12-22T07:58:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	done.
2011-12-22T07:58:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Trying again now…
2011-12-22T07:58:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	Same error.
2011-12-22T08:02:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	crud man.. I really dont know whats wrong.. Id hate to tell you to reinstall your OS.. but..
2011-12-22T08:07:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	wow, weird, I just got logged out totally randomly.
2011-12-22T08:08:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	that's the second time that's happened since yesterday
2011-12-22T08:09:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	How would I go about building it one step at a time?? Sorry I'm so ignorant :-D
2011-12-22T08:09:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	nah man your not ignorant, your just not a c programmer
2011-12-22T08:10:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	I honestly dont think thats gonna matter.. like I said.. I think your gonna have to reinstall your system.. I have no clue what the issue is
2011-12-22T08:12:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	wow. crap. I've put so much work into getting this system just the way I like it, and now to just have to scrap it all :-S There is no way that's happening :-D
2011-12-22T08:14:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	what's the recommended procedure for a badly broken system?
2011-12-22T08:15:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	reinstall? lol whenever my system gets f'ed up I usually switch distros
2011-12-22T08:18:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	hehe, that seems a little extreme. What I'm trying (and failing) to do in the long term is start yet another ubuntu spinoff distro. Since I can't even get one install to work right — much less many — I don't think it's *quite* ready yet…
2011-12-22T08:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	vouth	i dont think it is as much.. why would anyone use a tool they dont understand? your just asking for trouble
2011-12-22T08:19:00.000Z	vouth	DrPenguin	I was talking about switching distros.
