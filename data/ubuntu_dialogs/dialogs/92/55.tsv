2008-08-26T14:19:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I want to make a fresh install on a Raid/LVM system. Can I create two partitions on /dev/md0 (one for ext3 /boot, one as PV for LVM) or do I need to create two Raid devices (/dev/md0 for /boot and /dev/md1 as PV for LVM)?
2008-08-26T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	ive never set up software raid, only proper raid with a card
2008-10-22T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	open k3b again and then file -> open the iso
2008-10-22T17:22:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	The image file doesn't appear in the file open dialog. Which extension does k3b expect?
2008-10-22T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	iso
2008-10-22T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	or you can right click the iso and select open with k3b
2008-10-22T17:24:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	It's not an ISO image. It's a clone copy of an audio cd.
2008-10-22T17:25:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	When trying to open it, k3b says "unable to open file" after several minutes of reading (the 600 MB file)

2008-10-22T17:27:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Yes, I know. But it is not an ISO file.
2008-10-22T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	what sort of file is it?
2008-10-22T17:28:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	It's a "clone copy" image k3b made from an _audio_ cd.
2008-10-22T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	what does file /path/to/data say?
2008-10-22T17:30:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	"data"
2008-10-22T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	useful, id delete it and create an iso of the cd, then you can burn that dead easy
2008-10-22T17:32:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	You can't create an iso image of an audio cd, can you?

2008-10-22T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	why would you not be able to, its 1s and 0s like a data cd?
2008-10-22T17:34:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Yes, but I thought it's not ISO9660 formatted ....
2008-10-22T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	as long as it works its ok
2008-10-22T17:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	if you just wanna copy a cd you can choose that in k3b and it will realise you only have 1 drive and ask you to put a blank cd in
2009-01-26T19:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	devede can mak dvd iso, you could then extract the vob files from it
2009-01-26T19:20:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	I need it the other way round: I already have vob files and want to create an mpeg2 file (without recoding).
2009-01-26T19:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	do you have audio_ts and video_ts folders?
2009-01-26T19:21:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Yes.
2009-01-26T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	then k3b will accept those if you dont mind qt libs as well as gtk on your system
2009-01-26T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	i dont know what gnome app does it as i dont use it
2009-01-26T19:24:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	I don't use gnome. Isn't there a plain cmd line tool to convert vob to mpg files?
2009-01-26T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	mencoder / ffmpeg perhaps

2009-12-07T03:28:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Thank you. I've read the posting you pointed to but I couldn't find any relation to my problem. What do you mean?
2009-12-07T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	just saw a success story based on your error
2009-12-07T03:30:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	hmmm, did you paste the right URL? My error isn't even menrioned there
2009-12-07T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	theres a few hits for the error you posted
2010-04-18T18:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	if you then need to use the cd for a live environment for troubleshooting
2010-04-18T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	the alternate install is faster as it doesnt have to boot an x server first
2010-04-18T18:02:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Ok, thank you.
2010-04-18T18:05:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	He's using mdadm raid which your _kernel_ should support.
2010-04-18T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	if i bough a new hdd it'd cost more than any of my systems are worth
2010-04-18T18:12:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	I didn't understand your statement regarding a new hdd. How'S that related to using RAID?
2010-04-18T18:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	well i'd need a new hdd to use raid, considering all my systems are 7+ years old its not worth it as they are due to die soon
2010-04-18T18:15:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	I mainly use RAID to be able to continue work even when one of my drives fails.
2010-04-18T18:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	i have a backup every 6 hours so if any do i dont care
2010-04-18T18:16:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	But when a dirve fails, you have to shutdown and restore first. But that may depend on your needs.
2010-04-18T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	when they do fail i'll just find someone else who has an "old" pc to sell for 30 quid and i gots a new rig :)
2011-01-09T23:27:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Thank you, but I asked for the CD image download URL. What do I have to search for on http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download ?
2011-01-09T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	take your pick: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/   grab lucid or maverick and you'll be fine
2011-01-09T23:29:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Thank you
2011-01-09T23:30:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	These seem to be DVD images

2011-01-09T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	remember to MD5 test the ISO before use, so you know it's god
2011-01-09T23:32:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Thank you!
2011-01-09T23:33:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Is there a chance for anyone not knowing the "releases.ubuntu.com" link?
2011-06-29T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	i believe its a setting in ccsm

2011-07-07T17:46:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	It says it's solved in 10.04.1 (/etc/issue says Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS here). Any idea what else to do?
2011-07-24T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	sql loves 64bit

2011-10-06T03:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	that's  all I know, there is a panel item to switch layouts

2011-10-06T03:16:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Ok, found it and changed it to "Alt+Shift" because the default "both Alt keys" didn’t work. Thanks for your help.

2011-12-12T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	try CTRL+L
2011-12-12T14:23:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	ravedog: Yes, ctrl+l works. Thank you.
2011-12-12T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	no worries
2012-02-22T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	what browsers have you tried?
2012-02-22T04:32:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Only Firefox so far.
2012-02-22T04:35:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	It’s the same with chrome (as far as I can hear), so I assume it’s a Youtube problem.
2012-03-18T00:30:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Can you give an example, please?
2012-04-18T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	like RAM drive?
2012-04-18T15:03:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	What else could I mean?
2012-04-18T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	just clarifying, so as to not waste time going down the wrong avenue...
2012-04-18T15:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	a simple 'yes' is sufficient.
2012-04-18T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	if you add:    none /var/ramdisk tmpfs mode=1777,size=500M 0 0     to your /etc/fstab and make the directory /var/ramdisk you will have 500Mb of RAM disk to use (this is volatile storage so will be lost on reboot etc)
2012-04-18T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	I use that for my browser cache :)
2012-04-18T15:06:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	With a simple "yes" I couldn't have expressed my actual question: What else is there in Ubuntu/Linux that is a block device in RAM?
2012-04-18T15:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	well, ram itself is a block device
2012-04-18T15:07:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Thank you. If I add this line to fstab, where's my block device then?
2012-04-18T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	the storage can be accessed from /var/ramdisk and will be 500Mb in size
2012-04-18T15:09:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	It looks like a file system. I need a block device.
2012-04-18T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	so, like a sub-block device within the block device of the ram?
2012-04-18T15:11:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Yes, a "separate", size limited block device in RAM.
2012-04-18T15:11:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Like a partition or an LV for other block devices.
2012-04-18T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	can you see why I asked if you wanted a ramdisk now?
2012-04-18T16:41:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	No, I still don't know. When I need a "RAM drive", implies this a file system for you?
2012-04-18T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vlt	yes, its a storage drive, in RAM...
2012-04-18T16:43:00.000Z	vlt	ActionParsnip	Ok. For me it's just a drive (empty). And is there a way to create a size limited block device in RAM without an losetup'd file in a tmpfs?
