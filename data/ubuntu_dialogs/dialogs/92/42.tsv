2008-09-24T15:17:00.000Z	chilli0		does anyone know how to make an server with an old computer ?
2008-09-24T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	install server applications
2008-09-24T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	a computer is a server if it provides services to other systems
2008-09-24T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	well what sort of services do you want it to offer?
2008-09-24T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	you dont just have a "server" you have file servers, mail servers, domain controlling servers
2008-09-24T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	i think you need to study what a server actually is then move from there
2008-09-24T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	then install nubuntu as it has lots of security tools
2008-12-02T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	you can use gparted in live cd
2008-12-02T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	backup all important data before starting, just incase
2008-12-02T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	redownload one
2008-12-02T15:20:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	were can i get the live cd from?
2008-12-02T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	dry damnsmalllinux
2008-12-09T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	virtualbox is the command in terminal
2008-12-09T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	make sure you are a member of vboxusers
2008-12-09T15:10:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 why?
2008-12-09T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	or vbox won't run
2008-12-09T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	sudo adduser <your user name> vboxusers
2008-12-09T15:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	you can tab complete commands and file names in linux/bsd just like names in here
2008-12-09T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	also handles spaces in filenames too :D
2008-12-09T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	sweet
2008-12-09T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	dont forget to set the correct OS when you create the box so you get the right guest additions
2009-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	disable the internal one in bios
2009-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 is there a easyer way?
2009-01-04T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	its a better idea as its not neded. one less complication
2009-01-04T06:02:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 its not in the bois
2009-01-04T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	not sure then. Just ignore it then and install the usb one
2009-01-04T06:03:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 how can i ignore it?
2009-01-07T14:01:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 ... it works in one but not the other
2009-01-07T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	ive zero experience of webcams personally, the factoid may help some
2009-01-07T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	make sure the software is pointing to the correct device
2009-01-07T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	maybe someone else can chime in
2009-01-16T19:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	find and exec ;)
2009-01-16T19:23:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 pardon?
2009-01-16T19:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	find -name '*.mp3' -exec (do conversion on file found which will be named {} )
2009-01-16T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	the command will rifle throug the folder and subfolders and do whatever you say in the exec bit to any 8.mp3 files
2009-04-01T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	most likely a permissions ting

2009-10-08T13:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	you will also need to run it with: chromium-browser --enable-plugins

2009-11-22T17:16:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 Does it sort the files?
2009-11-22T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	no it just displays them well based on IDv3 tags
2009-11-22T17:17:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 Ok , i need the files sorted.
2009-11-22T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	organising them manually in the first place is a lot better
2009-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	restore from backup or you could try foremost
2009-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 Yeh , I was sorting the files , then backing them up.
2009-11-22T18:38:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 How can i get all the files?
2009-11-22T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	you wioll need to  look at how to run foremost, you may not be able to recover all data
2010-03-07T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	like a loudspeaker system?
2010-03-07T05:37:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 Yes. ( I have my computer pluged into my screen, that has hdmi ( so with sound) And i dont like walking over and changing over the wires.

2010-05-23T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	did you download the alternate iso?
2010-05-23T17:24:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	I have not. Its the desktop one...
2010-05-23T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	the upgrade doc clearly states the alternate iso is needed
2010-05-23T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades#Upgrading Using the Alternate CD/DVD
2010-05-23T17:28:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	 I just said , I will just use the network upgrade.
2010-05-23T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	ok cool
2010-05-23T17:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	sudo apt-get install update-manager-core; sudo do-release-upgrade
2010-05-23T17:30:00.000Z	chilli0	ActionParsnip	So , with the alternt cd whats the diffrence?
2010-05-23T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	well you'd use the debs on the CD instead of off the lucid repos, if you used the alternate cd you would most likely still have to web update to get the latest debs
2010-05-23T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chilli0	you can use the alternate to get the next release, you can go from 9.10 to 10.04 or 8.04 to 10.04 (LTS to LTS)
