2005-06-07T15:53:00.000Z	runedude		What program can I use to burn an ISO to a cdwriter (ubuntu ofcourse)
2005-06-07T15:53:00.000Z	joh	runedude	cdrecord
2005-06-07T15:54:00.000Z	joh	runedude	man cdrecord? or if you want to do it graphically, you can use k3b, gtoaster, xcdroast, etc.
2005-06-07T15:55:00.000Z	joh	runedude	ok, cdrecord -scanbus then ;)
2005-06-07T15:55:00.000Z	joh	runedude	you might want to do that as root.
2005-06-07T15:56:00.000Z	joh	runedude	try cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus
2005-06-07T15:56:00.000Z	joh	runedude	hmm, same problem here :P
2005-06-07T15:56:00.000Z	joh	runedude	I think it's a problem with the latest cdrecord package.
2005-06-07T15:57:00.000Z	joh	runedude	yeah, I posted a bug about that a long time ago which got fixed. Seems it has returned :p
2005-06-07T15:57:00.000Z	joh	runedude	try scanning the bus with cdrdao then
2005-06-07T15:57:00.000Z	joh	runedude	i.e. sudo cdrdao scanbus
2005-06-07T15:59:00.000Z	joh	runedude	as root ofcourse.
2005-06-08T16:17:00.000Z	runedude	joh	well, err, i get this error http://pastebin.com/292937
2005-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	joh	runedude	hmm...
2005-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	joh	runedude	is this a dvd?
2005-06-08T16:18:00.000Z	joh	runedude	how large is it?
2005-06-08T16:19:00.000Z	joh	runedude	how large is the iso?
2005-06-08T16:19:00.000Z	joh	runedude	should work then...
2005-06-08T16:20:00.000Z	runedude	joh	hm, yea, should, i had a few troubles with this writer on Windows.
2005-06-08T16:21:00.000Z	runedude	joh	as i mentioned, i have had several issues with this CDWriter on Windows, and just tried a new box I got.... Not working in a nutshell.
2005-06-08T16:23:00.000Z	runedude	joh	I contacted HP support and they had no idea what was wrong, they just told me to check out settings on Windows... that didnt work ofcourse :\ I think the drive is screwed up totally.
2005-06-08T16:25:00.000Z	joh	runedude	try without -overburn ?
2005-06-08T16:25:00.000Z	runedude	joh	yeh, i added that originally and posted the log of that
2005-06-08T16:27:00.000Z	joh	runedude	but did you try *without* -overburn?
2005-06-08T16:27:00.000Z	runedude	joh	without -overburn returns a error that the media isnt big enough, sorry, i misread
2005-06-08T16:28:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, that indicates that the drive is not working properly. This was a 64M iso?
2005-06-08T16:28:00.000Z	runedude	joh	no, its a 614MB is :)
2005-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, right. Should work anyways. So my guess is that the drive is not reporting to the OS it is able to write anything at all.
2005-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	runedude	joh	yea.... :( unfortunatly, i have no idea how to fix this issue.
2005-06-08T16:29:00.000Z	joh	runedude	have you tried with another cd burner?
2005-06-08T16:30:00.000Z	joh	runedude	ok... but this *might* be a problem with cdrecord itself. Not sure.
2005-06-08T16:30:00.000Z	joh	runedude	hehe
2005-06-08T16:30:00.000Z	runedude	joh	doubt it, i had the same problems on windows with countless applications
2005-06-08T16:31:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, ok.
2005-06-08T16:31:00.000Z	joh	runedude	I guess you just have to buy a new one then :(
2005-06-08T16:31:00.000Z	runedude	joh	lol.. hm.. wonder if i can smash the  drive first
2005-06-08T16:32:00.000Z	joh	runedude	haha, just throw it out of the window.
2005-06-08T16:32:00.000Z	joh	runedude	if it was a hard-drive, you could make two speakers out of it ;)
2005-06-08T16:32:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, that's not good.
2005-06-08T16:32:00.000Z	joh	runedude	hehe
2005-06-08T16:33:00.000Z	joh	runedude	so you've never actually been able to write with it properly?
2005-06-08T16:34:00.000Z	joh	runedude	so you've never actually been able to write with it properly?
2005-06-08T16:34:00.000Z	runedude	joh	nope
2005-06-08T16:34:00.000Z	joh	runedude	not even in windows?
2005-06-08T16:35:00.000Z	runedude	joh	nope, no where
2005-06-08T16:35:00.000Z	joh	runedude	I guess you shouldn't break it then :P send it back and ask for a replacement.
2005-06-08T16:35:00.000Z	runedude	joh	its a old model
2005-06-08T16:36:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, too bad.
2005-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	joh	runedude	HP isn't giving out firmware upgrades for free!?
2005-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	runedude	joh	they used to, but lost money perhaps by giving fixes to their own crappy models that never worked!
2005-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	joh	runedude	heh
2005-06-08T16:39:00.000Z	joh	runedude	there are laws about that you know :P but not if your cd writer here is very old.
2005-06-08T16:44:00.000Z	runedude	joh	well, after 10 minutes of tinkering with the writer, i got it open
2005-06-08T16:49:00.000Z	runedude	joh	well, guess i wont be able to write a cd for a long time, LOL.. anyways, erm... maybe i should try distrobutions with floppy installs
2005-06-08T16:49:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, that's sad :p
2005-06-08T16:49:00.000Z	runedude	joh	yea, sad that hp wont give you a working product
2005-06-08T16:49:00.000Z	joh	runedude	did the writer work before?
2005-06-08T16:51:00.000Z	runedude	joh	nope, the writer never worked..
2005-06-08T16:53:00.000Z	joh	runedude	crossover office?
2005-06-08T16:53:00.000Z	runedude	joh	yea, that
2005-06-08T16:53:00.000Z	joh	runedude	yep, thought so.
2005-06-08T16:54:00.000Z	runedude	joh	this cdwriter will make a nice warm fire for me to warm upto tonight :)
2005-06-08T16:56:00.000Z	joh	runedude	it will!? I didn't know cd writers made good fire"wood"
2005-06-08T16:56:00.000Z	runedude	joh	if it cant, ill burn it anyways:P
2005-06-08T16:56:00.000Z	joh	runedude	hehe :P then send it to HP
2005-06-08T16:57:00.000Z	runedude	joh	maybe i should burn it, then put it in a baggy, and send it to them :P
2005-06-08T16:57:00.000Z	joh	runedude	with a note attached: "This drive is broken, please send a new one"
2005-06-08T16:57:00.000Z	joh	runedude	yeah, sounds like a good idea.
2005-06-08T16:58:00.000Z	joh	runedude	well, never buy another product from HP, that's for sure.
2005-06-08T16:59:00.000Z	joh	runedude	also, I've not had a plesant experience with asus cd writers.
2005-06-08T05:15:00.000Z	runedude	joh	you k onw, I tried a yamaha drive once, didnt work either :(
2005-06-08T05:16:00.000Z	joh	runedude	eh? :(
2005-06-08T05:18:00.000Z	runedude	joh	yea.. well, i didnt do anything in depth... only at default didnt work.. my dad has a cdwriter in his laptop, but very little he lets me write a cd
2005-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	joh	runedude	so you tried another cd writer on the same system as the HP, and it didn't work either?
2005-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	runedude	joh	err.. believe so
2005-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	joh	runedude	then it's probably not the cd writer..
2005-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	joh	runedude	which version of cdrecord?
2005-06-08T05:20:00.000Z	runedude	joh	the thing is, now I put it into my server box (atm it used to be on my desktop box) , and it wont work on my server OR desktop
2005-06-08T05:20:00.000Z	joh	runedude	but it used to work on your desktop? :p
2005-06-08T05:20:00.000Z	runedude	joh	hang on , i got my server apart.. let me rewire it
2005-06-08T05:21:00.000Z	joh	runedude	have you tried using another program such as cdrdao to write a cd? just for testing?
2005-06-08T05:21:00.000Z	runedude	joh	nope
2005-06-08T05:22:00.000Z	joh	runedude	try that perhaps. (cdrdao is for audio cds)
2005-06-08T05:22:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, this is the same driver?
2005-06-08T05:22:00.000Z	joh	runedude	I thought you said this was a different one :P
2005-06-08T05:23:00.000Z	joh	runedude	oh, phew :P
2005-06-08T05:24:00.000Z	runedude	joh	maybe my best bet is to use floppies :(
2005-06-08T05:24:00.000Z	joh	runedude	maybe try netinstall?
2005-06-08T05:25:00.000Z	runedude	joh	heh.. of what?
2005-06-08T05:25:00.000Z	joh	runedude	ubuntu? :p
2005-06-08T05:26:00.000Z	runedude	joh	they have netinstall via floppy?
2005-06-08T05:26:00.000Z	joh	runedude	not sure...
