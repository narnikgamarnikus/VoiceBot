2009-06-13T04:19:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	*file
2009-06-13T04:20:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	&& means do this too if the previous command completes
2009-06-13T04:20:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	btw || is the total opposite of that

2009-06-13T04:22:00.000Z	renagadex	racecar56	what do I replace it with?
2009-06-13T04:23:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	e.g. you had a file called 'shutdown.run', you do 'chmod +x shutdown.run && ./shutdown.run' (no quotes) and suppose it would shut down the system
2009-06-13T04:24:00.000Z	renagadex	racecar56	says it cant find the file
2009-06-13T04:25:00.000Z	renagadex	racecar56	sudo chmod +x ~/desktop/ ati-driver-installer-9-3-x86.x86_64.run
2009-06-13T04:25:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	you are going to get yourself in a HEAP of trouble
2009-06-13T04:25:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	_DO NOT_ use ati's drivers
2009-06-13T04:25:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	use jockey-gtk
2009-06-13T04:26:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	a.k.a. hardware drivers

2009-06-13T04:29:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	hardware drivesr
2009-06-13T04:29:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	system > admin > hardware drivers
2009-06-13T04:30:00.000Z	renagadex	racecar56	it says no propriatary drivers are in use on this system
2009-06-13T04:31:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	then that means you are good with the open ones
2009-06-13T04:31:00.000Z	racecar56	renagadex	if you *REALLY* want them, then go ahead and use the official drivers
2009-06-13T04:48:00.000Z	renagadex	racecar56	Tremulous still wont start
