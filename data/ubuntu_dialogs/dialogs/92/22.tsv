2010-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	rmozden		So I'm gonna be a bit of a compile noob here for a minute and ask what else do I need to do to make ipset 4.4 work as a kernel module under ubuntu 10.10 server now that I have done a make & make install using the KERNEL_SRC= directive ???
2010-11-01T07:09:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	gcc - o exploit your0wned.c
2010-11-01T07:10:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Wow, arent you helpful
2010-11-01T07:11:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	are you being sarcastic?
2010-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	No worse thenyou with the "gcc -o exploit yourOwned.c"  bit
2010-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I must have been mistaken I thought you wanted to hack the  Gibson?
2010-11-01T07:12:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Nah, I just want ipset to work
2010-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	welcome to my world, looking for real support
2010-11-01T07:13:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	just venting on you, sorry
2010-11-01T07:14:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	My prob is that using mudule-assistant to make the 2.5 module version of ipset pukes.  I can and have compiled the 4.4 version from source but it installed it to my user dir
2010-11-01T07:14:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	No worries... I can take it as well as I can dish it too
2010-11-01T07:19:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	does make install not give you any options for ipset?
2010-11-01T07:20:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	It all ended up in my home folder
2010-11-01T07:37:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	New error message at least
2010-11-01T07:39:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	I suppose this is progress:  FATAL: Module ip_set not found.
2010-11-01T07:39:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	standbye I got like 50 PM's
2010-11-01T07:40:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	lucky you!  Hopefully to help fix your issue!
2010-11-01T07:40:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	they are everyones issues
2010-11-01T07:50:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	is there anyway I can just add what I've compiled since I see all the files in my home folder?
2010-11-01T07:51:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	or for that matter, use module-assistant to use the src I downloaded?
2010-11-01T07:51:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	you want to recompile kernel to include ... ?
2010-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Should work as a module
2010-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Did in 10.04 anyway
2010-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	im with you now
2010-11-01T07:53:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Right ... all the files compiled and are sitting in a directory  ( for ipset 4.4) but I either need to recompile with module-assistant specifying the 4.4 source or manually install the compiled files
2010-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Hopefully that made sense
2010-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	give me a moment, I know what you want. When you ran make it should have asked you about ipset
2010-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	the dist of ipset for ubuntu is broken and the src from ubuntu errors on compile hence why I went for 4.4 version instead of packaged 2.5
2010-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	did you do a...
2010-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	I followed the directions at http://ipset.netfilter.org/install.html
2010-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	standbye let me look
2010-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	and I did use the kernel_dir with the compile
2010-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	gonna re-do it right now
2010-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	good idea
2010-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Problem is that instead of putting the mod files in the proper mod directory it installs them to my home directory
2010-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	I perfer old school
2010-11-01T08:00:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	i understand, but it shouldntt make a diff
2010-11-01T08:02:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	does ubuntu support 'make menuconfig' ?
2010-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Not sure
2010-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	try it
2010-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	no rule for it
2010-11-01T08:04:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	can you do a 'make dep' + 'make clean' + 'make'?
2010-11-01T08:05:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	no rule for dep
2010-11-01T08:08:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	also try make with insmod
2010-11-01T08:08:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	negative
2010-11-01T08:08:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	also try make with insmod
2010-11-01T08:09:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	?
2010-11-01T08:09:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	lemme do a pastebin
2010-11-01T08:11:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	http://paste.ubuntu.com/523636/
2010-11-01T08:16:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Did the pastebin explain it better?
2010-11-01T08:16:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	yeah hold on
2010-11-01T08:17:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	Gotta love it when documentation is vague or lacking
2010-11-01T08:18:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	from what I can see, and somewhat shot in the dark. Is your kernel does not support to the module your trying to add
2010-11-01T08:18:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	it shoudl as there was kernel support in the last version of ubuntu ( 10.04) where I used module-assistant to put in 2.5.0 of ipset
2010-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	unfortunately the make dep doesnt work as there is no target to make it
2010-11-01T08:20:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	I would have used 2.5 again had it not puked on compile
2010-11-01T08:20:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	bugtraq?
2010-11-01T08:20:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	nothing there... already checked
2010-11-01T08:22:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I think your issues are above incl module IPV6
2010-11-01T08:22:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	not using ipv6 at all
2010-11-01T08:23:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	yep
2010-11-01T08:23:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	there is no rule to make dep
2010-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	every kernel, everr made
2010-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	here's the build log form module-assistant when I tried to use it to make the 2.5.0 module:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/523644/
2010-11-01T08:26:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	well looks good you did make clean
2010-11-01T08:26:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	no rule to make target .... remember, I'm not making the whole kernel, just a module
2010-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	your issue lies in make dep
2010-11-01T08:28:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	that last pastebin is the old way of getting ipset to work with the kernel, current version of ubuntu pukes and fails when it tries to work
2010-11-01T08:29:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	thats the best I can do.. is *GUESS* your missing dep
2010-11-01T08:29:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	appreciated but even when i run m-a a-i ipset , it fails
2010-11-01T08:30:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	still can be missing dependencies
2010-11-01T08:31:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	what a pain in the arse this has become.  I think I'm gonna go back to 10.04 and be done with it since it worked
2010-11-01T08:31:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	IMHO I would ditch Ubuntu all together
2010-11-01T08:32:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	which distro would you reccomend?
2010-11-01T08:32:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I am sure your issue is somewhere with Kernel dependency
2010-11-01T08:32:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I have been so far removed from Linux distros you wouldn' want to ask
2010-11-01T08:32:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	so go to slackware or similar?
2010-11-01T08:33:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	 this used to work btw:  http://www.jsimmons.co.uk/2010/06/08/using-ipset-with-iptables-in-ubuntu-lts-1004-to-block-large-ip-ranges/
2010-11-01T08:33:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I would go debian or slackware...Ubuntu is a end all be all desktop solutuion that does none of the above good
2010-11-01T08:34:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	trying a last ditch effort atm
2010-11-01T08:36:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I know make dep, make clean, make will work to put your module in to the kernel, on Debian...Ubuntu seems to be a Win7 distro of Debian. Easy to use on a 'default' sys
2010-11-01T08:36:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	this is their server version
2010-11-01T08:38:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	see if you can find a distro of SUSE
2010-11-01T08:38:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	non Novell molested
2010-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	try debian I think you will like it
2010-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	you made my day man, thanks for the chat
2010-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	you too.  Appreciate the help
2010-11-01T08:47:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	love to bullshit when you have time, look me up
2010-11-01T08:48:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	love to CHAT with YOU next TIME! no fould LANGUAGE I PROMISE!
2010-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	LOL screw em if they cant take a slang
2010-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	MetaPhaze	rmozden	I guess it isn't their fault, default language scripts ... :D
2010-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	rmozden	MetaPhaze	I'll show you why I need ipset... just a sec
