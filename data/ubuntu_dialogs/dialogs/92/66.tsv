2007-07-17T10:50:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	type  file filename  this will tell you what kind of file it is
2007-07-19T09:01:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	what program is that for?
2007-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	INADYN running as daemon
2007-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I have to use inadyn -u username -p password -alias hostname, etc etc
2007-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	did you try to read the README file that came along with it?
2007-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	So I want to run it at startup
2007-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Yes but I didn't find anything about adding it to sessions
2007-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	you create a script and put a symlink of it to   /etc/init.d/
2007-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	what sessions?
2007-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	To let it run when I start Ubuntu
2007-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	is it a program that runs like a daemon?
2007-07-19T09:04:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I could run it in terminal, or let it run as a daemon. I prefer daemon cause it'll update the dns if my IP has changed
2007-07-19T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	you create a script and put a symlink of it to   /etc/init.d/  <-- scripts here are started at boot
2007-07-19T09:05:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I don't know how to script :S
2007-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	now is the best time to learn it
2007-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Won't it work if I add the command to sessions?
2007-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	what is the sessions you are referring to? btw..come on pick up a book to learn scripting :)
2007-07-19T09:08:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	System > Preferences > Sessions
2007-07-19T09:08:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Man I just need to run it on startup, I can't learn programming for that
2007-07-19T09:09:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	well..thats not the right place to put it..take a look at /etc/init.d/   this directory has the S*  for startup..copy one
2007-07-19T09:12:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	There's screen, sendsigs, single, skeleton, stop-bootlogd, stop-bootlogd-single, stop-sreadahead, sysklogd....
2007-07-19T09:12:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	i take that back..maybe you can put one there on that sessions startup programs tab..but i have not done it before..so do a trial n error style ..:)
2007-07-19T09:13:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I've put some programs in there before and it worked on startup.... But not sure if I need quotes for those -option1 -option2 whatever thats called
2007-07-19T09:13:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	How do I know if it worked? How do I get a list of daemons
2007-07-19T09:14:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	ps aux  will tell you which processes are running then look for the one that normally end in d  like httpd
2007-07-19T09:15:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	try it..see if it works or without quotes
2007-07-19T09:16:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Is there a way I can save the results from ps aux into a text file? I typed that but the result is too big and it doesnt let me scroll
2007-07-19T09:17:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	you need to start reading up on linux commands..redirection, piping, page, more, less..
2007-07-21T16:50:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	So I type "sudo fsck /dev/hda1" ?
2007-07-21T16:50:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	wait..
2007-07-21T16:50:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	how many drives do you have?
2007-07-21T16:51:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Two hard disks
2007-07-21T16:51:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	what other os if you have installed?
2007-07-21T16:51:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Windows XP
2007-07-21T16:51:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	do you know which partions XP is on? which partition is linux is on?
2007-07-21T16:52:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Not exactly.. I let the wizard install ubuntu so i didn't mess it up
2007-07-21T16:53:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	i meant boot from the hd right?
2007-07-21T16:53:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	root@mypc
2007-07-21T16:54:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	okay...type mount and tell me whats on the list?
2007-07-21T16:55:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30621/plain/
2007-07-21T16:56:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	you're booted off your hd right?
2007-07-21T16:56:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I'm on the Live CD right now.. It won't let me boot from the hd
2007-07-21T16:57:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	well...what happens when you attempt to boot from the hd? whats the error or the very last prompt you're getting?
2007-07-21T16:58:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	It takes me to root@mypc and waits for a command.. If I press Ctrl+D(I don't know what it does), it shows a few lines of something I can't remember.. and gets stuck there
2007-07-21T16:59:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	fdisk -l /dev/hda
2007-07-21T16:59:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	whats the results of this?
2007-07-21T05:00:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay I typed it..
2007-07-21T05:00:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	result? Should I type mount again?
2007-07-21T05:00:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	whats the results of this?  fdisk -l /dev/hda
2007-07-21T05:00:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	no result
2007-07-21T05:01:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	it goes to the next line
2007-07-21T05:01:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	whats the results of this?  fdisk -l /dev/hdb
2007-07-21T05:04:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	now try  mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
2007-07-21T05:05:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	mount: special device /dev/hda1 does not exist
2007-07-21T05:06:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	try  chroot /   this is to chroot to the ramdisk i hope
2007-07-21T05:06:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay, done
2007-07-21T05:07:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	type  ls -la  and tell me what you get?
2007-07-21T05:08:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	It shows the directories of the CD
2007-07-21T05:08:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I think
2007-07-21T05:13:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	my system is old and slow..so hang on
2007-07-21T05:14:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	okay, no worries
2007-07-21T05:28:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	perseverance helps :)
2007-07-21T05:29:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	congrats..enjoy ubuntu
2007-07-21T05:29:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	greywhind: So it wasn't really a serious problem that I had, or was it? What may have caused it?
2007-07-21T05:30:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	doing an fsck is major...man fsck.. but it usually recovers from another boot record
2007-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	linux has this nice journaling system that keeps copies of those boot stuff
2007-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	You mean fsck?
2007-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	well someday when you get good at  it..come back and help others as payback :)
2007-07-21T05:38:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I'm here to do that with the bit of knowledge I have for people who're know lesser than me.
2007-07-28T06:04:00.000Z	bulmer	dissection	you can try gnome-terminal --help  and it tells you something about session...how it works i dont know
2007-11-07T01:14:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Both, but its not getting an IP when I tried with dynamic, though it was working fine till earlier today.
2007-11-07T01:14:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	And the WiFi light is also off.. I don't know why..
2007-11-07T01:15:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I did it from network settings
2007-11-07T01:16:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	The one in the gnome panel.. I don't want to do any commands for this... It'll not be easy when I need to use a different wireless network
2007-11-07T01:17:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	And my netspeed applet shows I'm connected to wmaster0.. not wlan0
2007-11-07T01:18:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay.. so what do I do
2007-11-07T01:20:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	It shows no wireless extensions for wmaster0, and under wlan0 it shows the SSID n other info, but it doesn't have an IP
2007-11-07T01:21:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	How? I don't even know what wmaster0 is.. I never set there anytime.. It just mysteriously showed up
2007-11-07T01:23:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	I don't have internet connection on the laptop
2007-11-07T01:24:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay I'll just type it.. wait
2007-11-07T01:28:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Btw, isn't there a command to turn on the light of the WiFi? I don't know why its turned off
2007-11-07T01:28:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=6202
2007-11-07T01:31:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Hmm, the same as what I gave you in the url.. without the lo, eth0 and wmaster0
2007-11-07T01:33:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	iwconfig wlan0 and then the IP?
2007-11-07T01:34:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Yeah, the IP is there..
2007-11-07T01:34:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	192.168.1.11
2007-11-07T01:35:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	No I can't
2007-11-07T01:39:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=6203
2007-11-07T01:42:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Yes, everything is setup properly. I can use the wireless LAN in Windows. It was working perfectly fine in Ubuntu too till a few hours ago.. Then I used a wired network for 2 hours, and once I switched back to Wireless, it stopped working
2007-11-07T01:45:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay, so what do I do next? I need to get the WiFi to work
2007-11-07T01:46:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay, I'll have to disconnect from here
2007-11-07T02:06:00.000Z	dissection	bulmer	Okay, I checked it out. The wired network works in Ubuntu. Wired and Wireless work in Windows. Everything's setup correctly, but wireless won't work in Ubuntu even though i did till earlier today
