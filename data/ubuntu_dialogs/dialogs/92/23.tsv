2009-12-28T22:15:00.000Z	datzy1		I need real help here, somehting is ammis
2009-12-28T22:16:00.000Z	datzy1		same
2009-12-28T22:16:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sounds like a fs-problem to me, had to cope the same today, after a foreign ext-driver ruined my raid
2009-12-28T22:16:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I think so... what can I do?
2009-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	boot a live cd and run fs-checks
2009-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	 I can't boot live cd, it will start flashing
2009-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I had to use alternate to install
2009-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	you machine won't boot a live cd (desktop) ?
2009-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	and you don't have another os it ? usb-boot supported ?
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	unfourtunatly, not with me
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	did you try to boot safemode ?
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I can't get to safe mode, I can't get to grub menu
2009-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	you should, when grub starts "Grub loading", press <Esc>
2009-12-28T22:21:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I'll try..
2009-12-28T22:23:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	y
2009-12-28T22:24:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	netroot
2009-12-28T22:24:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	ok, no flashing yet
2009-12-28T22:24:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	good sign, so partiton table still intact
2009-12-28T22:25:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo dhclient                                                         , got inet ?
2009-12-28T22:25:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	got address
2009-12-28T22:26:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2009-12-28T22:27:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	installed
2009-12-28T22:27:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	pastebinit /var/log/syslog
2009-12-28T22:28:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	give url from trml here
2009-12-28T22:30:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	http://pastebin.com/f73fb75e4
2009-12-28T22:31:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	looks like it worked
2009-12-28T22:31:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	your problem seems les severe, but let me look, second
2009-12-28T22:32:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	ok
2009-12-28T22:34:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo tune2fs -l | pastebinit
2009-12-28T22:35:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	http://pastebin.com/f2dc5c2c1
2009-12-28T22:36:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	not  the needed output, parameter l (lower L) forgotten , any way , lets ....
2009-12-28T22:36:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	force a fs-check at the next reboot and check your packages again afterwards
2009-12-28T22:37:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	 how do I force this?
2009-12-28T22:38:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo fdisk - l                                                                    , just one drive /dev/sda  ?
2009-12-28T22:39:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo fdisk -l                                                                    , just one drive /dev/sda  ?(^tyopo*)
2009-12-28T22:39:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	there is another drive too
2009-12-28T22:40:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	which is the ubu one ?
2009-12-28T22:40:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	sda
2009-12-28T22:41:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo tune2fs -c 1 /dev/sda
2009-12-28T22:43:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	Bad majic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda,  Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock
2009-12-28T22:43:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	aharrr
2009-12-28T22:44:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	something with ext4 and HDD firmware maybe?
2009-12-28T22:45:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	just a guess.. I don't know what else changed...
2009-12-28T22:46:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	so we are back to fs-check then ; the problem is e2fsck can easily damage a fs worse, when the hd is mounted , a  workaround is to have it mounted readonly, but that means altering grub's menu
2009-12-28T22:46:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I don't know...
2009-12-28T22:48:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	also can use another cd, like knoppix, which boots on most computers
2009-12-28T22:49:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	might have something like that sitting around
2009-12-28T22:52:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I found a D.S.L> cd
2009-12-28T22:53:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	live-able, terminal ? boot it, try man fsck
2009-12-28T22:56:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	ok, man fsck
2009-12-28T22:56:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	in the terminal-utils ?
2009-12-28T22:57:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	is that an option?
2009-12-28T22:58:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I don't know what you mean
2009-12-28T22:58:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	if you enter man fsck in dsl, get manpages ?
2009-12-28T22:58:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	yes
2009-12-28T22:59:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	fine, you know how to become root in dsl ?
2009-12-28T22:59:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	no
2009-12-28T22:59:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	heh, try su
2009-12-28T22:59:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	ok, don't know default pass
2009-12-28T23:01:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	sudo su
2009-12-28T23:01:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	so root now ?
2009-12-28T23:01:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	mount                                    , make sure sda isn't mounted
2009-12-28T23:02:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	nope it's not
2009-12-28T23:02:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	fdisk -l                           ,find out your linux partitions (boot and /)
2009-12-28T23:03:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	like /dev/sda1  /dev/sda5  or whatever , if you had no spereate /boot, it's just /root
2009-12-28T23:03:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	Boot /dev/hdb1
2009-12-28T23:04:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	looks hda1
2009-12-28T23:04:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	did you have a seperate /boot  ?
2009-12-28T23:04:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	both have a * under boot
2009-12-28T23:05:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	before you told sda is the ubu-hd, so hda in dsl
2009-12-28T23:05:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	ok
2009-12-28T23:05:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	man e2fsck             , there, too ?
2009-12-28T23:06:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	got a man page, but said before loading man page, this is nto a busy box application
2009-12-28T23:07:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	let's try, I feel little scary using a - for me- seldom distro, concerning ext4 and possibly different arguments
2009-12-28T23:08:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	e2fsck -p /dev/hda1
2009-12-28T23:10:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	says Filesystem has unsupported features while trying to open /dev/hda1
2009-12-28T23:12:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	could not be read, or does not describe a correct ext2
2009-12-28T23:13:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	there we are, ext2,max ext3 expected, not a good idea to try fsck without options then, your risk (and choice), or find  out if dsl supports ext3  least
2009-12-28T23:20:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	so, you can-on you own risk- do : fsck /dev/hda1  but I'd rather check that ext 3 is supported from that call, testdik-runs are really -- time intensive
2009-12-28T23:26:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	swapped my graphics card, got login screen first try
2009-12-28T23:27:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	it's somewhat strange, bad superblock won't have given you terminal with write-acces,  not sure what's on there
2009-12-28T23:29:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	I don't know either...
2009-12-28T23:29:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	so you could log in again now ?
2009-12-28T23:30:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	yea, GUI is working now
2009-12-28T23:30:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	anyway, force fsck to do a check soon then
2009-12-28T23:30:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	ok
2009-12-28T23:31:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	sudo tune2fs -c 1 /dev/sda
2009-12-28T23:35:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	guess it didn't like my nvidia 6600
2009-12-28T23:36:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	very unlikely
2009-12-28T23:38:00.000Z	datzy1	DasEi	Well, maybe made the diff between GUI and no GUI, guess there is still that fs issue
2009-12-28T23:41:00.000Z	DasEi	datzy1	think so, too but weird is still, that if you got a damaged superblock, it will be monter ro then, so no paste-install possible there, your syslog tells about 3ratelimits when gdm was running, the only fact about your fs is dsl - which I can't know- works so or else
