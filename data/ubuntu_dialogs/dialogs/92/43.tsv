2009-03-05T09:22:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	ok
2009-03-05T10:23:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	it kinda like a desklet but very detailed
2009-03-05T10:26:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	or use route
2009-03-05T10:30:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	you thinking what I'm thinking?  No default route?
2009-03-05T10:31:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	but his windows box has one, unless he has a custom /etc/networking/interfaces it should pickup the route
2009-03-05T10:31:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	yes but SHOULD is the key word.
2009-03-05T10:32:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	he's already doing it
2009-03-05T10:33:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	tweak66 nvm
2009-03-05T10:33:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	the difference with 'netstat -rn' and 'route' is that netstat -rn won't try and reverse-lookup the names on the IPs.
2009-03-05T10:34:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	usefull to know
2009-03-05T10:35:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	 try this: 'route' and then type 'netstat -r' and compare the results
2009-03-05T10:35:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	 and then try 'netstat -rn' and you'll see what I mean.  I prefer it without the names and instead just the IPs
2009-03-05T10:35:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	Its the same, is it an alias in bash?
2009-03-05T10:36:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	not an alias, just a different command.  Identical results, though.  It's faster when it doesn't have to do a lookup, however.
2009-03-05T10:36:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	yes much
2009-03-05T10:39:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	its weird that his kernel update messed this up. He may have to pick an earlier kernel from the grub menu and version lock it
2009-03-05T10:47:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	tweak66 lol perhaps route would have been better...
2009-03-05T10:47:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	true
2009-03-05T10:48:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	wait.  one thing at a time bud.
2009-03-05T10:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	we're going to make his head explode.  :)
2009-03-05T10:49:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	if the kernel doesn't matter maybe its something in modules-restricted?
2009-03-05T10:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I don't know.  That's out of my scope.
2009-03-05T10:50:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	He may have to blacklist his current driver
2009-03-05T10:50:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I'm a network guy and BASIC linux guy.  I know a little about a lot and a lot about a little, but not a lot about a lot.  :)
2009-03-05T10:50:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	studying for my CCNA
2009-03-05T10:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	kudos to you.  I've heard Cisco certs are tough stuff.
2009-03-05T10:52:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	It took a CCENT but I thought it was harder then it was almost got 100%, but subnets are huge in it
2009-03-05T10:53:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	OSPF, MPLS, Frame-relay, cdp, VTP, and trunking might explode this channel :)
2009-03-05T10:58:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	Whats an APICA address doing in there?
2009-03-05T10:58:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I was wondering the same.  My wireless pulls that subnet when I screw up the connection encryption
2009-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	usually that address is only used if it can't find an address
2009-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	but mine's got it as well
2009-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	mine doesn't
2009-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	i have 2 NICs in mine, one does not have a connection.  That's probably why.
2009-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	wait yes I do
2009-03-05T10:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	 lol
2009-03-05T11:00:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	but that metric will make it never come into efect
2009-03-05T11:00:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	that's correct
2009-03-06T06:45:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	you been netboot?
2009-03-06T06:45:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	mean*
2009-03-06T06:46:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	if that's the proper term, yes.  PXE Linux boot
2009-03-06T06:46:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	well your in luke cause I have and with about 50 computers successfully install with it
2009-03-06T06:46:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	awesome.  :)
2009-03-06T06:47:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	it just fails when loading GRUB.  The drive itself has been formatted so I know 100% that it's blank right now
2009-03-06T06:47:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	to make sure i know the objective, you wan't to install ubuntu over the network? or run it?
2009-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	install it
2009-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	clarification.  Install it TO a laptop FROM the server.
2009-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	how far have you gotton it
2009-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I can boot, I get:  GRUB Loading stage1.5.  (2 lines down) GRUB loading, please wait... (next line) Error 22
2009-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	that's it
2009-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	is this before or after installing?
2009-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	before installing.  It's not a successful netboot, yet
2009-03-06T06:50:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	might be, but how is it getting GRUB if not?
2009-03-06T06:50:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	PXElinux does not even touch grub, so grub must be coming from the disk
2009-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	no disk.  It's booting over the network.
2009-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	you may have to go into your bios and look for a PXE boot option
2009-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	does it run PXE?
2009-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I don't know.  I'm going to assume no since it doesn't get that far.
2009-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	at least I see nothing about PXE unless it flashed too fast.  rebooting to try and see again
2009-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	can you get a boot list? ex f12
2009-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	rechecking.
2009-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	Usually you can see PXE do its thing cause dhcp is slow sometimes
2009-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	that was it.
2009-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I stand corrected.
2009-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	works now
2009-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	yeah I'm at a boot: prompt.  The only problem is I forgot to extract the .iso to the tftp directory lol
2009-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	ISO!
2009-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	ubuntu offers a netboot image
2009-03-06T06:54:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	understood.
2009-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/intrepid/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz is what you want
2009-03-06T06:56:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	understood.  Good thing you stopped me, i was using the one from Hardy
2009-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	how is it going to do a full installation from a 9 meg download?
2009-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	it pulls packages from the internet
2009-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	gotcha
2009-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	that tar file is pretty easy all you have to do is extract that to tftpboot
2009-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	already doing that.
2009-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	if I choose a 'cli' install, does that equate to server?
2009-03-06T07:00:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	its basicly an install without anything ubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-server
2009-03-06T07:00:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	ok
2009-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	I like netbooting cause it give you wayyy more options
2009-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	this is really humorous...  it's not finding my network adapter
2009-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	you know...  THE ONE IT BOOTED OFF OF.  *chuckle*
2009-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	well that is a problem
2009-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	get better hardware or compile custom kernel?
2009-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	ah that explains it
2009-03-06T07:03:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	why?  Have you dealt with them/
2009-03-06T07:03:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	try it with another computer... no not really, Ive dealt with acer aspire though
2009-03-06T07:04:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	havn't use the eeepc much.. you might have to add modules into initrd. buts thats complicated
2009-03-06T07:04:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	try it with another computer?  lol well i can't really do that.  I don't have that option.  I mean I could use a CD drive with an IDE-USB adapter, but I'm going to toy with this for a bit. I'll let you know what I find.
2009-03-06T07:04:00.000Z	dotblank	Huufarted	k
2009-03-06T07:26:00.000Z	Huufarted	dotblank	I give up.  :)  CD on USB incoming...
