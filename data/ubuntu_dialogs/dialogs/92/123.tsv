2005-03-14T17:51:00.000Z	Atrophy		come on guys... someone out there knows how to do this...
2005-03-14T17:53:00.000Z	Atrophy		Hello?
2005-03-14T17:54:00.000Z	Atrophy		hey shock... could you tell everyone else out there that I need help with Samba?
2005-03-14T17:54:00.000Z	Atrophy		apparently they can't hear me...
2005-03-14T17:56:00.000Z	Atrophy		Hey... does anyone have any experience with configuring samba in hoary?
2005-03-14T17:56:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	dont ask polls, ask specific technical questions.
2005-03-14T17:57:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	then you are a bit out of luck, or perhaps you should change venue.
2005-03-14T17:57:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	also, it is not terribly difficult to find out...
2005-03-14T17:58:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	try 'locate ....' and perhaps 'dpkg -L samba'
2005-03-14T17:58:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	perhaps you need to discover that Samba is a _server_.
2005-03-14T17:59:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	except of course for 'smbclient'.
2005-03-14T17:59:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	there are plenty of very nice tutorials on how to setup Linux/MS Windows file sharing in both directions.
2005-03-14T06:00:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	do a nice google search for "smbmount" and "smbfs"
2005-03-14T06:01:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	so why do you write I still can't see my xp box from this computer? That's a bit generic.
2005-03-14T06:01:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	Samba is a _server_.
2005-03-14T06:03:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	thats a very inappropriate wau of saying things.
2005-03-14T06:04:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	no... What you are really saying is that you dont see a browser list for your workgroup or whatever.
2005-03-14T06:05:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	try 'smbclient -L HOSTNAME' or 'smbclient -L IPADDR'
2005-03-14T06:05:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	sometimes browse list problems exist that are totally independent from share access issues.
2005-03-14T06:06:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	there is no problem with that.
2005-03-14T06:06:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	first thing, try 'smbclient -L 127.0.0.1'
2005-03-14T06:06:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	yes, as to the browse list. But not as to accessing shares.
2005-03-14T06:07:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	have you restarted the Samba server? As in '/etc/init.d/smb restart'?
2005-03-14T06:08:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	tail -4 /var/log/samba.log.smbd
2005-03-14T06:09:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	tail -4 /var/log/samba/log.smbd # oops
2005-03-14T06:09:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	if you dont know what that will do, you need a lot of background information before you can setup and/or debug a Samba setup...
2005-03-14T06:10:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	and?
2005-03-14T06:11:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	the problem is that there is no such thing as ''neurosurgery: the 21 days at home simple course'' :-)
2005-03-14T06:12:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	setting up Samba can take an experienced network administrators _days_.
2005-03-14T06:12:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	so if one is a newbie, either things ''just work'' or, bad news.
2005-03-14T06:13:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	yes, but it takes time.
2005-03-14T06:13:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	I can show you around, but I was trying to hint you are asking the wrong questions, which is always a bad sign...
2005-03-14T06:14:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	for example, in which _mode_ have you set up shares on your host and/or the XP machines? Domain? Domain authentication? NT Domains? WfW shares?
2005-03-14T06:15:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	which admin tool?
2005-03-14T06:15:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	if you know the name of a tool, just use 'dpkg --search' or 'locate' to find it.
2005-03-14T06:15:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	ahhh, a GUI tool...
2005-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	these details matter sort of greatly :-).
2005-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	there are zillions of GUI tools for Samba, you can use any. Not just SWAT.
2005-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	for example, for example, try 'locate smb.conf', how many do you get...
2005-03-14T06:17:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	but that's different from saying something like ''admin tool''. Usually when you say 'tool' one understands a command line program.
2005-03-14T06:18:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	but you dont even know the name of that GUI...
2005-03-14T06:18:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	it is a bit hard to help you find something that used to be somewhere but now is somewhere else but you don't know its name :-).
2005-03-14T06:19:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that's not its name, it is the label on the menu entry...
2005-03-14T06:19:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	ack. But I gather you have tried some other Samba config tool...
2005-03-14T06:20:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	try to see if you can start 'gnosamba'
2005-03-14T06:22:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	also, try to do 'locate smb.conf'
2005-03-14T06:23:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	perhaps SWAT put the config in the wrong place.
2005-03-14T06:23:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	in the meantime try 'apt-get install gnosamba'
2005-03-14T06:23:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	how do you know? try 'locate smb.conf | xargs ls -ld'
2005-03-14T06:24:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	then 'cd /var/log/samba/' and have a look at the logs. Do you see anything suspicious in those logs?
2005-03-14T06:25:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	in particular the 'smb' logs, not 'nmb'
2005-03-14T06:25:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	dont worry about 'gnosamba' then.
2005-03-14T06:26:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that is very very bad news.
2005-03-14T06:26:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	you are making me suspect your system is a bit messy...
2005-03-14T06:27:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	then how comes it has got the wrong logs?
2005-03-14T06:27:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	I dont get it.
2005-03-14T06:28:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	what Samba does by default is to open a different log for each client that tries to access it.
2005-03-14T06:28:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	plus one for recording ''local'' messages, like startup/shutdown.
2005-03-14T06:29:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	yes, and what does it say?
2005-03-14T06:30:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	then do a nice 'ls -ltr' and find something recent that has got something in it... Samba is pretty good at logging stuff
2005-03-14T06:31:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that's really impossible, because you just told me that 'tail ...log.smbd' had at least one line in them...
2005-03-14T06:31:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that's really impossible, because you just told me that 'tail ...log.smbd' had at least one line in iy
2005-03-14T06:31:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that's really impossible, because you just told me that 'tail ...log.smbd' had at least one line in iy
2005-03-14T06:31:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that's really impossible, because you just told me that 'tail ...log.smbd' had at least one line in it OOPS
2005-03-14T06:32:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	OK, so find one that is not empty. And 'less -S log.smbd' and have a scroll
2005-03-14T06:34:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	no error messages?
2005-03-14T06:34:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	OK, next check then...
2005-03-14T06:37:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	wait a sec
2005-03-14T06:38:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	paste the result of: netstat --inet -a -n | sort -t: +1n  | egrep "13[789] |445"
2005-03-14T06:38:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	just to check the server is up and attached to the right addresses and ports.
2005-03-14T06:39:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	in the meantime try 'smblient -L IPADDRofAWINDOWSSERVER'
2005-03-14T06:39:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	in the meantime try 'smbclient -L IPADDRofAWINDOWSSERVER' # oops
2005-03-14T06:41:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	evidently the problem is more like the browse list took a bit to come up.
2005-03-14T06:42:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	I suggest that you find the nearest wall with a strong hard surface and hit your forefront repeatedly on it :-)
2005-03-14T06:42:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	browse list issues can be weird. That's why one should first check with 'smbclient' using the IP address.
2005-03-14T06:42:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	next check with the DNS domain name, and next with the NetBIOS name.
2005-03-14T06:43:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	if the NetBIOS name works, that means the browser list is fully up.
2005-03-14T06:44:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that probably is a Nautilus issue.
2005-03-14T06:44:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	I suggest switching to #Gnome. There may also be #Nautilus.
2005-03-14T06:44:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	note that there are a few other SMB share browsers...
2005-03-14T06:44:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	try 'apt-cache search smb
2005-03-14T06:46:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	I am a command line person, always use 'smbclient'...
2005-03-14T06:47:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	when a few can be listed with 'apt-cache search smb' and installed with 'apt-get install ...' you kmight as well try a couple.
2005-03-14T06:51:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	that lists them...
2005-03-14T06:51:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	ah, interesting, and logical :-)
2005-03-14T06:53:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	I knwo that type of end user -- then they come to me asking me to fix their messes...
2005-03-14T06:54:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	sure, it _looks_ like it works. But then MS Windows users have been trianed to consider ''reformat and reinstall'' as a default system administration activity.
2005-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	yes, I noticed. BTW I started to take you seriously when you answered NT Domain, thus demonstrating you had done a bit of himework.
2005-03-14T06:58:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	ah sure, but there is a difference between someone who has done homework and someone who is shooting in the dark.
2005-03-14T07:00:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	check your 'Buttons' and 'ZAxis' options are right in the X config.
2005-03-14T07:05:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	and 'Buttons' is 5?
2005-03-14T07:05:00.000Z	Blissex	Atrophy	the mapping is fine.
