2007-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	skhobotu		no good. My camera doesn't even come up as a fremovable drive. It says it can't be mounted
2007-07-24T08:15:00.000Z	skhobotu		done that. My camera comes up with swithc to USB ode when i connect the cable, but my computer won't recognise it as a drive.
2007-07-24T08:15:00.000Z	skhobotu		Samsung Kenox Q1
2007-07-24T08:17:00.000Z	skhobotu		I also tried to use my SD card, but ubuntu doesn't receive any support for SD cards.
2007-07-24T08:18:00.000Z	skhobotu		How does slavik use SD cards in ubuntu.the forums also say there is no support.
2007-07-24T08:19:00.000Z	skhobotu		I have a USB card reader which has Linux support ,but it won't read this card or connect via USB! &*)**&^
2007-07-24T08:20:00.000Z	skhobotu		the card works fine in Windows, just not in Linux.
2007-07-24T08:21:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	alright... connect the card reader, and then enter the command "sudo lsusb"
2007-07-24T08:21:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I don't know if ubuntu comes with lsusb by default though...
2007-07-24T08:27:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... good so far...
2007-07-24T08:27:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	try not to spam the channel ;)
2007-07-24T08:27:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	alright... is that myson thing your card reader for sure?
2007-07-24T08:28:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I guess it could  be the card... how are you trying to mount it?
2007-07-24T08:29:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	FWIW, my card reader shows up in lsusb, but I know it's dead :(
2007-07-24T08:30:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	does the card reader show up in the GUI? somewhere in nautilis?
2007-07-24T08:31:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... does it give a reason for refusing mounting?
2007-07-24T08:32:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	hmm... tricky...
2007-07-24T08:33:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	do you have any idea what the mount option in question is?
2007-07-24T08:33:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	that won't help at all
2007-07-24T08:33:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I'm thinking you need to configure your /etc/fstab...
2007-07-24T08:33:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... do a "sudu gedit /etc/fstab"
2007-07-24T08:34:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	don't be frightened by the syntax... it's not _that_ difficult
2007-07-24T08:34:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	got it?
2007-07-24T08:35:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	see the file things on the left? see the column that has /dev/? look for any devices that have "sd" in their name. sd stands for serial device, and usb is serial...
2007-07-24T08:36:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	do you see any sd devices?
2007-07-24T08:37:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	actually... I might be making this too hard... I just looked online and there seems to be an easier way to do this...
2007-07-24T08:37:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	wait, do you know if you're using sata for your hard drive or not?
2007-07-24T08:38:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	alright...
2007-07-24T08:38:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	open another terminal and enter the command "pmount /dev/sda1 flash"
2007-07-24T08:39:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	it might error out... if it does, try "pmount /dev/sdb flash"
2007-07-24T08:39:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I've never used pmount before... I'm experimenting on you ;)
2007-07-24T08:40:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	only a warning, ehh? see if it worked...
2007-07-24T08:40:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	browse to /media/flash
2007-07-24T08:42:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... we need to find where your flash drive is in /dev. try "sudo fdisk -l". but don't just copy/paste the output, tell me which "sd" drives you see
2007-07-24T08:45:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... the hdas are probably your hard drive's partitions...
2007-07-24T08:46:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	try this command.... the manual way: "sudu mkdir /media/flash && sudu mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/flash"
2007-07-24T08:49:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	:D
2007-07-24T08:49:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	err, I don't drink ;)
2007-07-24T08:50:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	you should look into configuring fstab... that's probably what's wroing
2007-07-24T08:50:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	skhobotu so... you still see fstab? do you see a line with sdb1 on it already?
2007-07-24T08:52:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... well, tell me the one line (only one line ;P) that the sdb1 is on
2007-07-24T08:53:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	no biggie, it's sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-07-24T08:55:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I'm guessing the "mount option" that was causing your problem resides in /etc/fstab
2007-07-24T09:06:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	how do i resolve the probmem in fstab?
2007-07-24T09:06:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay...
2007-07-24T09:06:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	paste the one line that you see /dev/sdb1 on
2007-07-24T09:08:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	what next?
2007-07-24T09:08:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	/dev/sdb1  /media/sdb1    ntfs nls=iso8859-1,users,umask=000,gid=users,user,owner,uid=root  0  0
2007-07-24T09:09:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay, you see that part with all the commas in it? that looks like cruft that colud mess everything up...
2007-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	change it so that it says simply "users,auto" instead
2007-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	ohh, and.... I don't think it's ntfs either
2007-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	change the "ntfs" to say "vfat"
2007-07-24T09:11:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	and you can change the "/media/sdb1" to say "/media/flash"
2007-07-24T09:11:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	done
2007-07-24T09:11:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	after that... you can test it by trying "sudo umount /media/flash" and then "sudo mount /media/flash"
2007-07-24T09:11:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	make sure you write the file first though ;)
2007-07-24T09:12:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	OK
2007-07-24T09:12:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	so i just save the file I have open and that will do it??
2007-07-24T09:12:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	yeah, you need to save the config... that's how things work ;)
2007-07-24T09:13:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	Sorry :used to windows point and click!!
2007-07-24T09:15:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	how'd it go? after you ran those commands, could you still access the directory?
2007-07-24T09:16:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay....
2007-07-24T09:16:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	it was working a minute ago with the "mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/flash", right?
2007-07-24T09:18:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	didn't that command I told you earlyer work? the fstab should have worked, i'm supprised...
2007-07-24T09:18:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	sure... "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/flash"
2007-07-24T09:20:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	so... does that command work or not? are you able to browse your card's files?
2007-07-24T09:21:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... well... i'll check if your fstab is right... gimme a sec to formulate a good fstab line...
2007-07-24T09:22:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	your fstab should read "/dev/sdb1 /media/flash vfat users,auto 0 0"
2007-07-24T09:25:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	alright, did you make sure that line in your fstab looked exactly like I made it?
2007-07-24T09:27:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay...
2007-07-24T09:27:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	paste your fstab here and let me look at it http://pastebin.com/
2007-07-24T09:37:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	perfect, I see your problem ;)
2007-07-24T09:28:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	paste it to pastebin.com and give me the url
2007-07-24T09:31:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	http://pastebin.com/m36696aa9
2007-07-24T09:31:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	thanks
2007-07-24T09:32:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	no, that's not what I meant... can you paste your whole /etc/fstab file in there?
2007-07-24T09:32:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I can't really see line 15 if I don't have the file ;P
2007-07-24T09:36:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	http://pastebin.com/db4730eb
2007-07-24T09:37:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	it now says I can't mount it because i don'thave enough privileges
2007-07-24T09:37:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	see line 15 and 16? they should be one line
2007-07-24T09:38:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	all you have to do is make line 16 go on the end of line 15... making one line
2007-07-24T09:38:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	easy
2007-07-24T09:39:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... now try unmounting it and mounting it again... you can probably use the gui this time
2007-07-24T09:41:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	huh...
2007-07-24T09:42:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	on the command line, does "sudo umount /media/flash && sudo mount /media/flash" work?
2007-07-24T09:44:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	sorry, I meant umount :/
2007-07-24T09:44:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	I'm bad today X-D
2007-07-24T09:47:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	tried sudo unmount :/
2007-07-24T09:52:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	okay... I'm not sure what's wrong exactly... I need to go to bed right now... as long as that "sudo mount /media/flash" command works, you'll be fine. if that doesn't work, "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/flash" will... just write those things down...
2007-07-24T09:52:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	that looks perfect, I don't know what's wrong with the gui....
2007-07-24T09:53:00.000Z	neutralNeo	skhobotu	anyway... 'night... I hope you figure it out :/
2007-07-24T09:58:00.000Z	skhobotu	neutralNeo	what the initial command line for mounting the camera card?
