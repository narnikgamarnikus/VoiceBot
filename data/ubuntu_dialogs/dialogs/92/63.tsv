2010-10-19T04:09:00.000Z	melon		HELP Please: I am running 10.10-64bit and I installed Python 2.7 from source on the Python home page. And now I am having all kinds of things not work, is there any way for me  to uninstall python 2.7 and point everything back to python 2.6.5 (thats still installed)
2010-10-19T04:11:00.000Z	vocx	melon	dummy, the easy way is to remove the entire python2.7 structure but first do this "file /usr/bin/python"
2010-10-19T04:12:00.000Z	melon	vocx	doing now
2010-10-19T04:13:00.000Z	melon	vocx	it said : /usr/bin/python: symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/python'
2010-10-19T04:14:00.000Z	vocx	melon	now "file /etc/alternatives/python"
2010-10-19T04:16:00.000Z	melon	vocx	it said: " /etc/alternatives/python: symbolic link to `/usr/lib/python2.6' "
2010-10-19T04:18:00.000Z	vocx	melon	mmm that can't be right. My /usr/bin/python points directly to /usr/bin/python2.6
2010-10-19T04:19:00.000Z	melon	vocx	yet if i type "python" it brings me to 2.7 & many pyGTK apps stopped working (PlayOnLInux, Screenlets, etc.)
2010-10-19T04:20:00.000Z	melon	vocx	so I tried reinstalling pyGTK from source and now I can not get to the software center or update packages I get a error: " Failed to execute child process "/usr/bin/software-center" (Permission denied) "
2010-10-19T04:22:00.000Z	vocx	melon	did you install python 2.7 or pyGTK from source? Or both? The original is still 2.6.5 right?
2010-10-19T04:24:00.000Z	melon	vocx	I installed both from source first 2.7 then many apps were nto working sending me pygtk errors and such so I installed gyGTK from source (latest) and now I can not get to software center, about gnome and a few other things.  And yes python 2.6.5 is still intact did not uninstall it
2010-10-19T04:25:00.000Z	vocx	melon	where is the folder with the source code? Perhaps you can go into it and do "sudo make uninstall"
2010-10-19T04:25:00.000Z	melon	vocx	they are both on my desktop. so try sudo make uninstall?
2010-10-19T04:28:00.000Z	vocx	melon	yes, get inside pyGTK 2.7 first and then Python 2.7
2010-10-19T04:28:00.000Z	vocx	melon	that is, going backwards
2010-10-19T04:28:00.000Z	melon	vocx	okay doing now
2010-10-19T04:33:00.000Z	melon	vocx	it seemed to work fine on pyGTK doing python 2.7 now
2010-10-19T04:34:00.000Z	vocx	melon	Okay, I guess it takes some to compile and install eh? I've never done it myself. It's bad to try to upgrade Python, which is a critical component of the system.
2010-10-19T04:36:00.000Z	melon	vocx	does ntot ake to long for pyGTK i was reading over everything making sure nothing carzy happend. & when I tried to uninstall python 2.7 I got: "  make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'.  Stop. "
2010-10-19T04:37:00.000Z	melon	vocx	not take*
2010-10-19T04:39:00.000Z	vocx	melon	mmm... did you follow a guide to install Python, or just downloaded from python.org and hit make
2010-10-19T04:41:00.000Z	melon	vocx	did the standered "./configure; make; sudo make instal"l (not all in one line though)
2010-10-19T04:42:00.000Z	vocx	melon	usually the is a make uninstall.  Well. Okay, so "python -V"  gives 2.7?
2010-10-19T04:43:00.000Z	melon	vocx	"Python 2.7"
2010-10-19T04:46:00.000Z	vocx	melon	perhaps removing the symlink "sudo rm /usr/bin/python"
2010-10-19T04:47:00.000Z	melon	vocx	Okay i got no errors so I am assuming it worked. What next?
2010-10-19T04:49:00.000Z	vocx	melon	perhaps recreating the simlink to python 2.6 like "sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.6 /usr/bin/python"
2010-10-19T04:51:00.000Z	melon	vocx	Okay it went through error free
2010-10-19T04:52:00.000Z	vocx	melon	of course, those removing recreating didn't do much.  Now just "python -V" should give you the previous 2.6.5
2010-10-19T04:53:00.000Z	melon	vocx	damn it still says "Python 2.7"
2010-10-19T04:54:00.000Z	vocx	melon	you are running this in the terminal, or idle or something?
2010-10-19T04:54:00.000Z	vocx	melon	"file /usr/bin/python"    "file /usr/bin/python2.6"      "file /usr/bin/python2.7"
2010-10-19T04:55:00.000Z	melon	vocx	lol yes in the standered terminal
2010-10-19T04:56:00.000Z	vocx	melon	type "which python"   and  "echo $PATH"
2010-10-19T04:57:00.000Z	melon	vocx	"/usr/bin/python: symbolic link to `/usr/bin/python2.6'"                               "/usr/bin/python2.6: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped"                              ""/usr/bin/python2.7: ERROR: cannot open `/usr/bin/python2.7' (No such file or directory)"
2010-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	melon	vocx	 "/usr/local/bin/python
2010-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	vocx	melon	okay now "file /usr/local/bin/python"
2010-10-19T05:00:00.000Z	melon	vocx	it says:   "  /usr/local/bin/python: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, not stripped "
2010-10-19T05:02:00.000Z	vocx	melon	rename that piece of cr*#/&   "sudo mv /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/python2.7" and then you should be able to "python -V" and 2.6.5
2010-10-19T05:03:00.000Z	melon	vocx	ran first command no error 2nd commanded says: "bash: /usr/local/bin/python: No such file or directory"
2010-10-19T05:04:00.000Z	vocx	melon	what?   again "which python" please
2010-10-19T05:05:00.000Z	vocx	melon	actually "which -a python" please  that lists all pythons found in the PATH
2010-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	melon	vocx	"which -a python" returned: "/usr/bin/python"
2010-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	vocx	melon	so please run "python -V"
2010-10-19T05:07:00.000Z	melon	vocx	 it says: "bash: /usr/local/bin/python: No such file or directory"
2010-10-19T05:08:00.000Z	vocx	melon	noooooooo, why??? I don't get it.
2010-10-19T05:08:00.000Z	melon	vocx	just a though why shouldn't't I just reinstall;l python 2.6.5 *pyGTK through package manager?
2010-10-19T05:08:00.000Z	vocx	melon	can you access the package manager now?
2010-10-19T05:09:00.000Z	melon	vocx	yes
2010-10-19T05:09:00.000Z	melon	vocx	just tried yet I do not know if it will let me install them yet though
2010-10-19T05:09:00.000Z	vocx	melon	I feel there is something missing. There is no other python in your path, but when you can from the terminal, it still behaves weird.
2010-10-19T05:11:00.000Z	melon	vocx	if I type "locate /bin/python" i get "/usr/bin/python
2010-10-19T05:11:00.000Z	vocx	melon	perhaps try "sudo rm /etc/alternatives/python" which was a result earlier.  And then again "python -V"
2010-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	vocx	melon	if you want to use locate, use "sudo updatedb" and then "locate python"
2010-10-19T05:13:00.000Z	melon	vocx	python -V returned: "Python 2.6.6"  =D
2010-10-19T05:13:00.000Z	vocx	melon	after or before "rm /etc/alternatives/python"
2010-10-19T05:14:00.000Z	melon	vocx	after
2010-10-19T05:14:00.000Z	vocx	melon	so. We are good, I guess. Are your programs messed up?
2010-10-19T05:15:00.000Z	melon	vocx	let me chack
2010-10-19T05:16:00.000Z	melon	vocx	well it let me open ubuntu software center let me chack to see if it will install
2010-10-19T05:17:00.000Z	melon	vocx	everything seems to be working I just have to test to Updates and then it will be fixed =D
2010-10-19T05:18:00.000Z	melon	vocx	everything seems to be working great thank you
2010-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	vocx	melon	according to my logs, you own me money!!!
2010-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	melon	vocx	if I may ask though, how did we fix it? There was someone on the forums that had the same issue as myself and I would like to post how to fix it, or I can link you
2010-10-19T05:19:00.000Z	melon	vocx	put it on my tab =D
2010-10-19T05:21:00.000Z	vocx	melon	I recall in the programming subforum, there may be a guide somewhere buried there, explaining how to setup different versions of Python without borking your system. Basically, we removed the "links", so the original python takes precedence.
2010-10-19T05:22:00.000Z	melon	vocx	ah okay thanks
2010-10-19T05:24:00.000Z	vocx	melon	It is probable that you need to do something like "./configure --prefix=/usr/local  --suffix=2.7" or something, before compiling and installing. That should give you a separate python, under a different name, so it doesn't clash with the standard python.
2010-10-19T05:26:00.000Z	melon	vocx	ah okay, later I will try that in a VM
2010-10-19T05:49:00.000Z	vocx	melon	here a sample http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1521813&highlight=installing+python+3
2010-10-19T05:51:00.000Z	melon	vocx	WOW thank you!
2010-10-19T05:53:00.000Z	vocx	melon	I seriously was searching for something better. I do remember one thread where it was explained, the actual configure options. That thread only says to remove symlinks which is what we did.
2010-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	melon	vocx	but then you have to reset it right
2010-10-19T05:55:00.000Z	melon	vocx	someone replied on the thread I was talking about (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1595510) is that what we did?
2010-10-19T05:57:00.000Z	vocx	melon	YES. OMG that newbie asked a few questions on the programming subforum and he still decides to go to absolute beginner talk. OMG, some people never learn. Perhaps, when he is 16,
2010-10-19T05:58:00.000Z	melon	vocx	LOL! Which is the newb? The OP or the guy who posted?
2010-10-19T05:59:00.000Z	vocx	melon	the OP, The last guy is okay.
2010-10-19T06:00:00.000Z	melon	vocx	XD I see. I doubt he will ever fix his issue
2010-10-19T06:02:00.000Z	vocx	melon	"how did you install 2.7?"  "I installed it myself"    ROFL
2010-10-19T06:03:00.000Z	melon	vocx	Yeah I kinda wondered about that. I tried to save the thread by posting as much info as possible because how he described it (what little he did <.<) I knew he had the same issue as me
2010-10-19T06:10:00.000Z	vocx	melon	yes! I remember now. The trick was to use "make altinstall"   like alternative install instead of just "make install"  See here: http://www.python-forum.org/pythonforum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=10977   First post is informative, more info in that same thread, and last post shows altinstall
2010-10-19T06:11:00.000Z	melon	vocx	does this work for other programs as well?
2010-10-19T06:13:00.000Z	vocx	melon	no, "make" is not magic, it depends on a file called "Makefile". Inspecting this file tells you about its options, but is hard to "read" or understand for newbies.
2010-10-19T06:16:00.000Z	melon	vocx	I believe that just by poking around them some times. But couldn't you just ctrl-F and look for it?
2010-10-19T06:18:00.000Z	vocx	melon	yes, although, sometimes, a "rule" such as "altinstall" could be just a fictitious rule to call other rules under the hood, so it gets complicated. But sure, inspect other Makefiles, the more you learn the better.
2010-10-19T06:18:00.000Z	melon	vocx	Ah I see, thanks for the advice.
2010-10-19T06:20:00.000Z	vocx	melon	yes, search the programming forum for altinstall. This is a thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1529315&highlight=altinstall
2010-10-19T06:22:00.000Z	melon	vocx	So if i altinstall 2.7, who to i call it from the terminal?
2010-10-19T06:22:00.000Z	melon	vocx	how*
2010-10-19T06:24:00.000Z	vocx	melon	well, I'm not sure, but perhaps "python2.7"   The fact is that all should have the version in the name. Only a single link "python" provides the default,
2010-10-19T06:52:00.000Z	vocx	melon	good luck. See you. Your name makes me hungry.
2010-10-19T06:53:00.000Z	melon	vocx	lol Okay cya later
