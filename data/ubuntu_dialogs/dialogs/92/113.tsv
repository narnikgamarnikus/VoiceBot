2006-11-12T12:41:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	``asoundconf list'' (in a terminal)
2006-11-12T12:41:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	Names of available sound cards:
2006-11-12T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	and is any sound audible?
2006-11-12T12:42:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	nope
2006-11-12T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	pastebin ``amixer''
2006-11-12T12:43:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/246474 ... cheers for the help dude .... :-)
2006-11-12T12:44:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	amixer set 'IEC958 5V' off && amixer set 'IEC958 In Phase Inverse' off && amixer set 'Line-In Mode' 'Rear Output'
2006-11-12T12:47:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	yeah, but still no luck I"m afraid ...
2006-11-12T12:47:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	which output jack are you using?
2006-11-12T12:48:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	the green one
2006-11-12T12:48:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	umm...
2006-11-12T12:48:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	I have no idea what that means. Front? Rear?
2006-11-12T12:49:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	what do you mean by output jack exactly ?
2006-11-12T12:49:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	your chipset driver notes 2 output jacks
2006-11-12T12:51:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	try unmuting 'Exchange DAC'
2006-11-12T12:51:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	how do I do that ?
2006-11-12T12:51:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	amixer set 'Exchange DAC' on
2006-11-12T12:53:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	nope that doens't work either I'm afraid ...
2006-11-12T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	pastebin your /proc/asound/card0/codec*/*
2006-11-12T12:54:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	back in 1 hr
2006-11-12T13:02:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	we don't ship alsaconf in alsa-utils; it was removed in Hoary.
2006-11-12T13:02:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	so what am I supposed to do then ?
2006-11-12T13:03:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	alsaconf isn't going to help you fix your mixer levels. Try using aumix, which uses the much simplified oss api.
2006-11-12T13:03:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	I don't care about my mix levels. I just want sound to work ...
2006-11-12T13:03:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	flash sound off the internet won't work either ...
2006-11-12T13:04:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	your issue is a mixer level, and I'm on the phone so I can't concentrate on your issue atm
2006-11-12T13:05:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	k thanks anyway ...
2006-11-12T13:05:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	ask me again in 20 minutes
2006-11-12T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	did you install aumix and use it as I suggested?
2006-11-12T13:25:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	how can you tell that ?
2006-11-12T13:25:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	because I handle alsa for ubuntu.
2006-11-12T13:25:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	ahh .... teach me MASTER ... :-)
2006-11-12T13:26:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	did you check w/ aplay that nothing is audible?
2006-11-12T13:26:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	e.g., aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav
2006-11-12T13:28:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	yeah, tried it. The speakers should go into the green plug right :-P
2006-11-12T13:29:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	remember I don't know the physical layout of your particular hardware, only the driver-level specifics
2006-11-12T13:30:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	yeah, the aplay sound isn't working either ...
2006-11-12T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	does it hang, or does it complete with no audible sound?
2006-11-12T13:30:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	completes with no audible sound
2006-11-12T13:31:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	did you pastebin your codec dump? (contents of /proc/asound/card0/codec*/* )
2006-11-12T13:31:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	no such file :-(
2006-11-12T13:31:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	what about /proc/asound/card0/codec* ?
2006-11-12T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	is cmipci a directory or a file?
2006-11-12T13:34:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	regular empty file
2006-11-12T13:34:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	pastebin its contents
2006-11-12T13:34:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	it's empty
2006-11-12T13:34:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	oh wait sorry
2006-11-12T13:34:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	it's located on a pseudofilesystem, it will appear via ls to be empty, but it's not.

2006-11-12T13:36:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	thanks, now I need ``lspci -nv''
2006-11-12T13:37:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/246491 ... thanks :-)
2006-11-12T13:42:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	(sec, I'm crossreferencing the code)
2006-11-12T13:45:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	have you created an asoundrc?
2006-11-12T13:45:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	nope. I figured there'd be one in there already ?
2006-11-12T13:45:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	not by default.
2006-11-12T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	don't worry about it now.
2006-11-12T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	amixer set 'Four Channel Mode' off
2006-11-12T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	warning, turn down your speakers/headphones first
2006-11-12T13:48:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	it's still as dead as a doornail ... :-(
2006-11-12T13:49:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	ok, amixer set 'Exchange DAC' off
2006-11-12T13:49:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	yip
2006-11-12T13:49:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	"yip"?
2006-11-12T13:51:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	sorry. Yes, I've turned the DAC Exchange off but still no sound
2006-11-12T13:52:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	and you're outputting to analog speakers, not a digital receiver, correct?
2006-11-12T13:53:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	I have a headphone plugged in ... yes
2006-11-12T13:54:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	how many output jacks are there?
2006-11-12T13:54:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	output jacks ? blue pink green ...
2006-11-12T13:54:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	you have _3_?!
2006-11-12T13:55:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	OK it's working dude :-)
2006-11-12T13:56:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	0000:00:0d.0 Multimedia audio controller: C-Media Electronics Inc CM8738 (rev 10) ... ??
2006-11-12T13:57:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	how is sound working? did you switch jacks?
2006-11-12T13:58:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	yeah, I switched between the soundcard and the onboard sound. But I'd done that before I made your changes and it didnt work back then ...
2006-11-12T13:58:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	err, you only have one pci sound chipset listed in lspci -nv
2006-11-12T13:58:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	what's the output from ``asoundconf list''
2006-11-12T13:59:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	Names of available sound cards:
2006-11-12T13:59:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	ok, what did you do to "get sound," then?
2006-11-12T14:00:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	just switched to the onboard sound ...
2006-11-12T14:00:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	how did you do that? Did you physically switch jacks?
2006-11-12T14:00:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	pci also has a ...
2006-11-12T14:00:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	yes
2006-11-12T14:01:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	you only have one sound card.
2006-11-12T14:01:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	(that alsa recognizes)
2006-11-12T14:01:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	so the CM... is the onboard card then ?
2006-11-12T14:01:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	correct.
2006-11-12T14:02:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	i guss that explains it then. Although I did test it with the onboard also ...
2006-11-12T14:03:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	you don't have two distinct cards recognised by alsa, which is what I've been saying.
2006-11-12T14:03:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	OK cool thanks. Is there anyway to know from lspci whether the card is onboard or off ?
2006-11-12T14:03:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	maybe it's in dmesg ?
2006-11-12T14:04:00.000Z	crimsun	graeme	it's _the_ sound card
2006-11-12T14:05:00.000Z	graeme	crimsun	thanks dude :-)
