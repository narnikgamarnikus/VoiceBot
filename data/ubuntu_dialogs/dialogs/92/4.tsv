2012-06-02T03:52:00.000Z	Yago		anyone have software for Win XP that allows you to resize partitions?
2012-06-02T03:52:00.000Z	Yago		I tried MPWE 7 but its not free
2012-06-02T03:53:00.000Z	escott	Yago	gparted on the livecd/liveusb
2012-06-02T06:29:00.000Z	escott	Yago	anything NTFS is windows related
2012-06-02T04:53:00.000Z	escott	Yago	gparted is an application. gparted doesnt "boot" what are you trying to boot
2012-06-02T04:53:00.000Z	Yago	escott	i have it on a live cd and i booted it
2012-06-02T04:53:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so you booted the normal livecd, and selected try ubuntu. then what
2012-06-02T04:54:00.000Z	Yago	escott	no, i booted it solo ... as in there is no OS booted up
2012-06-02T04:54:00.000Z	escott	Yago	gparted is an application. it is NOT an OS. what did you boot?
2012-06-02T04:55:00.000Z	escott	Yago	what is the link to the thing that you downloaded and burned?
2012-06-02T04:55:00.000Z	Yago	escott	gparted.sourceforge
2012-06-02T04:56:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so to echo Jordan_U thats not an ubuntu product. not the right channel for issues with it. but gparted is on the livecd, so just boot your install CD select "try ubuntu" and then you can use gparted
2012-06-02T04:56:00.000Z	Yago	escott	oh so i have to burn another live cd with ubuntu on it?
2012-06-02T04:56:00.000Z	escott	Yago	if you want help in this channel you need to be using ubuntu in some form
2012-06-02T04:57:00.000Z	Yago	escott	I am, the original problem was attempting to remove ubuntu from a dual boot
2012-06-02T04:57:00.000Z	Yago	escott	and someone told me to burn gparted, boot up with it and remove the partition
2012-06-02T04:57:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so do you have your original install media for ubuntu. b/c you can use that
2012-06-02T04:58:00.000Z	Yago	escott	no nor do I have for Windows either
2012-06-02T04:58:00.000Z	escott	Yago	first you need to boot windows and reinstall the windows bootloader. it used to be "fixmbr" i dont know if thats still correct
2012-06-02T04:59:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok is that a program?
2012-06-02T04:59:00.000Z	escott	Yago	it is/was a windows command. i wouldn't trust me that its correct. i dont use windows
2012-06-02T05:02:00.000Z	escott	Yago	no you dont want that
2012-06-02T05:03:00.000Z	escott	Yago	you want this http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
2012-06-02T05:03:00.000Z	escott	Yago	you are downloading Wubi. that thing you are looking at is wubi
2012-06-02T05:04:00.000Z	Yago	escott	oh, there was another link on that page that wasn't an exe
2012-06-02T05:05:00.000Z	escott	Yago	ok i see the confusion. you were using the thing at the bottom not at the top. thats the same as the link i sent you
2012-06-02T05:05:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so the top of my link or the bottom of your link should be fine. but you should be downloading a 700MB iso file
2012-06-02T05:05:00.000Z	escott	Yago	not an EXE
2012-06-02T05:07:00.000Z	escott	Yago	i would personally discourage that. i dont like the way wubi is structured. i think you are better off with dual boot or vbox, but not this weird wubi halfway house
2012-06-02T05:08:00.000Z	Yago	escott	Yeah, but the people who use the computer are not big Ubuntu fans and I want something thats easy to remove in any circumstance.
2012-06-02T05:09:00.000Z	escott	Yago	vbox would meet that "easy to remove" standard, and you have the benefits of a virtualized system (assuming your hardware is decent)
2012-06-02T05:09:00.000Z	Yago	escott	thats the problem, my hardware is far from decent, http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/opgx240/en/ug/specs.htm
2012-06-02T05:24:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok i burned the disc
2012-06-02T05:24:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so boot it, and select "try ubuntu"
2012-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	escott	Yago	when you have fully booted let me know
2012-06-02T05:34:00.000Z	Yago	escott	im fully booteed
2012-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	escott	Yago	open a terminal and run "sudo apt-get install mbr" then you can run install-mbr /dev/sda (i'm guessing that sda is correct but if you have one hard drive it should be)
2012-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	escott	Yago	you could verify that by checking "sudo parted -l" and identifying what disk has the NTFS partition
2012-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok... mbr is a non-existent package
2012-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	escott	Yago	do NOT include the partition number in the "install-mbr /dev/sda" command just the disk label so "sda" not "sda1"
2012-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	escott	Yago	run software-properties-gtk and make sure that "univer" is selected
2012-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	escott	Yago	actually it doesnt even show up there. try "sudo apt-get update" and then try to install mbr
2012-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	Yago	escott	still
2012-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	escott	Yago	are you online in the livecd?
2012-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	escott	Yago	does /etc/apt/sources.list not include "universe"
2012-06-02T05:44:00.000Z	Yago	escott	nope
2012-06-02T05:46:00.000Z	escott	Yago	odd that they do that. but you can add a line. sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list copy one of the other lines but replace the bit after "precise" with "universe" and add it to the file
2012-06-02T05:47:00.000Z	Yago	escott	it says deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universal
2012-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	escott	Yago	universe not universal?
2012-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so sudo apt-get update -- does it mention universe?
2012-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	Yago	escott	it says unable to find expected entry 'unisversal/binary-i386/Packages' to release file (wrong sources.list entry or malformed file
2012-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	escott	Yago	can you paste the error message and the contents of sources.list to paste.ubuntu.com
2012-06-02T05:54:00.000Z	Yago	escott	I AM INSTALLING MBR
2012-06-02T05:54:00.000Z	Yago	escott	sorry for caps
2012-06-02T05:54:00.000Z	escott	Yago	ok cool
2012-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	Yago	escott	I am setup
2012-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	escott	Yago	then sudo parted -l and look for the NTFS I suspect it will be /dev/sda# where the number doesn't matter to us
2012-06-02T05:56:00.000Z	escott	Yago	then you can run sudo install-mbr /dev/sda (without the number)
2012-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok it says disk: /dev/sda
2012-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	escott	Yago	"sudo install-mbr /dev/sda"
2012-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	Yago	escott	thats it?
2012-06-02T05:59:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so now you can reboot and you should go directly to windows (no grub) confirm that. then reboot back to the livecd, and start "gparted" and use that to delete the ubuntu partition and increase the size of the windows partition. before you do that can you tell me if there was anything before NTFS on /dev/sda or was it /dev/sda1
2012-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok thank-you
2012-06-02T06:03:00.000Z	Yago	escott	Windows boots up
2012-06-02T06:04:00.000Z	Yago	escott	im booting live cd again
2012-06-02T06:04:00.000Z	escott	Yago	ok. so now you should be able to remove the ubuntu and resize the NTFS provided you to not change where he NTFS starts
2012-06-02T06:04:00.000Z	Yago	escott	what do you mean by not changing where it starts?
2012-06-02T06:07:00.000Z	escott	Yago	if NTFS was partition 2 you should not remove partition1 and make NTFS grow at the front
2012-06-02T06:07:00.000Z	Yago	escott	NTFS meaning windows right?
2012-06-02T06:09:00.000Z	escott	Yago	yes
2012-06-02T06:09:00.000Z	escott	Yago	the windows partitions will appear as NTFS partitions in gparted because thats the type
2012-06-02T06:10:00.000Z	Yago	escott	k
2012-06-02T06:23:00.000Z	escott	Yago	do you know what you need to do at this point?
2012-06-02T06:24:00.000Z	Yago	escott	i just run sudo gparted right?
2012-06-02T06:24:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok
2012-06-02T06:25:00.000Z	escott	Yago	gksudo is preferred
2012-06-02T06:25:00.000Z	Yago	escott	oh... its already open. So ill close it and run "gksudo gparted"?
2012-06-02T06:26:00.000Z	escott	Yago	damage is done
2012-06-02T06:26:00.000Z	escott	Yago	but with a livecd it doesnt matter so much because you can always reboot
2012-06-02T06:27:00.000Z	Yago	escott	thank-you. NTFS is sda1... i think its the first partition
2012-06-02T06:27:00.000Z	escott	Yago	should be. just select the stuff that is not the NTFS (and after it) and delete it. then select the NTFS and grow it to fill the free space
2012-06-02T06:28:00.000Z	Yago	escott	ok, does the non-NTFS part include the "D:/" drive
2012-06-02T06:29:00.000Z	escott	Yago	so check the types of the filesystems
2012-06-02T06:30:00.000Z	Yago	escott	how about file system "extended"?
2012-06-02T06:31:00.000Z	escott	Yago	ext4 is ubuntu. extended is a container for other partitions
2012-06-02T07:18:00.000Z	Yago	escott	Hey man
2012-06-02T07:18:00.000Z	escott	Yago	yes
2012-06-02T07:18:00.000Z	Yago	escott	I just wanna say thank-you for everything
2012-06-02T07:19:00.000Z	Yago	escott	I owe you alot
2012-06-02T07:20:00.000Z	escott	Yago	no problem. it wasnt a hard question, and that is what we are here for
2012-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	Yago	escott	lol that helps? oh and hi
2012-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	escott	Yago	i was assuming/hoping it would say the word proxy in there
