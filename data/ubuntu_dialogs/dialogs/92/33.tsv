2011-08-13T19:29:00.000Z	ElTimo		I keep running into a problem with wubi. Whenever I try to run it from a CD, it feels the need to redownload the iso.
2011-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	ElTimo		I have limited bandwidth, so this simply isn't an option for me.
2011-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	I strongly suggest you install traditionally (non-wubi)
2011-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I'm hesitant to install normally. This laptop has Optimus, and I want to see if I can get bumblebee to work properly before I do anything permanent.
2011-08-13T19:31:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	I have no idea what Optimus and bumblebee is.  Try running the liveCD to see if they work?
2011-08-13T19:32:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I tried to do it, but ubuntu hangs at the loading screen.
2011-08-13T19:32:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Is this a liveCD or a liveUSB  Do you get any error messages when / before it hangs.
2011-08-13T19:32:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Press escape during boot to see more info
2011-08-13T19:32:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	LiveUSB, and no.
2011-08-13T19:33:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Can you describe the hang?
2011-08-13T19:33:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Oh I was trying to switch VT's lol. Hold on.
2011-08-13T19:33:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	That was a good thought too
2011-08-13T19:35:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	hello
2011-08-13T19:35:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Rebooting my laptop now.
2011-08-13T19:36:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	k
2011-08-13T19:36:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	We can talk while we work on the target machine?
2011-08-13T19:36:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I have two laptops ;)
2011-08-13T19:37:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	excellent
2011-08-13T19:37:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Now that's odd...
2011-08-13T19:37:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	it's booting?
2011-08-13T19:37:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	This time it didn't even show the bootsplash.
2011-08-13T19:37:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Gave me a couple errors though
2011-08-13T19:38:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	mhmmm, I take it you didn't do anything differently.  What errors?
2011-08-13T19:40:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	http://pastebin.com/UuNLRX0p
2011-08-13T19:40:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Oh and I forgot to mention that the fan starts running like crazy once it hangs.
2011-08-13T19:41:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	You have intel graphics?
2011-08-13T19:42:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Yeah. Intel and Nvidia. That's what Optimus is. It switches video cards depending on load.
2011-08-13T19:42:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I have whatever's attached to the Core i7 and a Geforce 525m
2011-08-13T19:43:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Oh. Escape doesn't do anything.
2011-08-13T19:43:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Well escape makes the splash go away.  Do the num / caps lock keys make the lights change (proof themachine is not frozen)
2011-08-13T19:44:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	That's a major problem. I don't have num/caps lock lights so I can't tell if it's panicking.
2011-08-13T19:44:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	ok.  Hang on
2011-08-13T19:45:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Is the screen showing those errors and just stuck there?
2011-08-13T19:46:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	It's showing the purple booting screen and doing a whole lot of nothing.
2011-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Is this a dell? mac?
2011-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Dell Vostro 3750
2011-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	a-ha :)
2011-08-13T19:48:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	a-ha what?
2011-08-13T19:49:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Found this: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201101-6969
2011-08-13T19:49:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	still looking
2011-08-13T19:50:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	It's certified even though it doesn't work. Good call there, Canonical.
2011-08-13T19:50:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	hahaha
2011-08-13T19:50:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	that should matter?
2011-08-13T19:51:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	No, but you never know. There could be some proprietary drivers they had to install.
2011-08-13T19:51:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	I have found this: https://lists.launchpad.net/hybrid-graphics-linux/msg00864.html   He has the same error as you on the same hardware however he is able to boot (cause he can run dmesg) which implies the errors we're seeing are not related to the can't boot problem
2011-08-13T19:52:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I've gotten it to boot before. That's the weirdest part.
2011-08-13T19:52:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	What did you do to get it to boot?
2011-08-13T19:52:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Plugged in the usb stick, turned it on, and smacked F12 like a redheaded stepchild.
2011-08-13T19:52:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Why F12?
2011-08-13T19:53:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	To get the one-time boot menu open.
2011-08-13T19:53:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	for the bios.  You don't have to do that normally?
2011-08-13T19:53:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I was doing it so I could boot if from usb
2011-08-13T19:54:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	sure, but you mentioned having to do that the time it worked.  This implies that you don't have to press F12 everytime.  (It's confusing me.  Is pressing F12 significant in the laptops ability to boot?)
2011-08-13T19:55:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Oh sorry. No, that's what I have to do to get it to boot from USB.
2011-08-13T19:55:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	ok
2011-08-13T19:55:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	It boots windows just fine.
2011-08-13T19:56:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	one common thing.  Check the drives using windows
2011-08-13T19:56:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	You mean the usb drive?
2011-08-13T19:56:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	no, the partitions of the hdd
2011-08-13T19:57:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	sometimes when the partitions are dirty or have errors ubuntu doesn't boot.  (or boot irradcially).  You could also (to save time) pop the hdd out for a second and boot with no hdd
2011-08-13T19:59:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Odd. The pre-boot assessment just popped up.
2011-08-13T19:59:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	the bios post?
2011-08-13T19:59:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	No. Dell's hardware test program that they install on a separate partition of the HDD.
2011-08-13T20:00:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	mmm, strange
2011-08-13T20:05:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	OK. Now that that's over, let's try booting again.
2011-08-13T20:05:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	hahaha, what did it want from you?
2011-08-13T20:05:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	It ran all the tests automatically. I think my laptop is possessed.
2011-08-13T20:06:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	ha
2011-08-13T20:06:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Ok, I took out the splash boot option.
2011-08-13T20:07:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Let's see what it has to say.
2011-08-13T20:07:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	ok, good idea
2011-08-13T20:08:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Huh. It came up with the same screen as before. There's an error there that I didn't notice before though.
2011-08-13T20:08:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	[drm:intel_dsm_platform_mux_info] *ERROR* MUX INFO call failed
2011-08-13T20:09:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	googling...
2011-08-13T20:09:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	And of COURSE it's because I have sandy bridge. Of course.
2011-08-13T20:09:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	That's what I think is the issue yes
2011-08-13T20:10:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Hold on, I have an idea.
2011-08-13T20:10:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	holding
2011-08-13T20:11:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I'm gonna go grab an arch stick and see if that boots.
2011-08-13T20:11:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	:)
2011-08-13T20:13:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Damn. Looks like the most recent arch I have is 2010.05. Project for another day it looks like.
2011-08-13T20:13:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	ok
2011-08-13T20:13:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	Not sure why it's not booting.  I see other reports of that error and again they can boot anyways
2011-08-13T20:14:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I can try using an actual CD, though I doubt that'll help much.
2011-08-13T20:14:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	agreed
2011-08-13T20:15:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Hmm. An idea is floating around in my head, but it seems dumb.
2011-08-13T20:15:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	what is it?
2011-08-13T20:15:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	I saw a way to install ubuntu directly from the iso using the USB creator.
2011-08-13T20:16:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	good luck with that!
2011-08-13T20:16:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	Like I said, dumb.
2011-08-13T20:16:00.000Z	edbian	ElTimo	crazy and fun!
2011-08-13T20:16:00.000Z	ElTimo	edbian	That's how I roll.
