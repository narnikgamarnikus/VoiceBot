2009-12-16T07:59:00.000Z	rahduke		i just compiled and installed mplayer with vdpau, how do i check to see if it's working
2009-12-16T07:59:00.000Z	rahduke		don't seem right
2009-12-16T08:00:00.000Z	rahduke		also how can i use it by just double clicking a video, not using terminal
2009-12-16T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 be sure you are using the mpklayer you compiled - not one thats allready installed perhaps.
2009-12-29T06:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Found one on sale for like $30 last xmas...  :)
2009-12-29T06:36:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	can u point me somewhere?
2009-12-29T06:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 when in doubt go with the bigger brand/names - not  just somthing thats $5 cheaper.
2009-12-29T06:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 pricewatch.com perhaps.
2009-12-29T06:36:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	the price discrepencies on these things are insane
2009-12-29T06:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Im not even using mine at the moment. some of them have  to have drivers taht are not in the normal kernels.  so thats is somthing to watch out for
2009-12-29T06:37:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	so its not something that is just PnP?
2009-12-29T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 depends on what kind of 'nas' it is.. The one i had. with the drivers actually appeared as a 'local' disk. I could even run gparted on it.
2009-12-29T06:38:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	thats what i'm looking for, do u remember the brand?
2009-12-29T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Not really 'ndas' perhaps.
2009-12-29T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 it could do USB and nas.  i  had issues using it as nas with some filesystems
2009-12-29T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 its a 'netdisk' by 'ndas'
2009-12-29T06:40:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	wireless?
2009-12-29T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i just found it in a box. :) i wonder what size HD is even in it.
2009-12-29T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Not wireless.. that would be rather slow.
2009-12-29T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i dont think its GB wired either..  but id get one now a dasys that was at least a GB lan connection
2009-12-29T06:40:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	I dont want wireless, but when i googled NDAS thats all i found
2009-12-29T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i imagine many can do both.
2009-12-29T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Im mainy heading toward external sata drives now.
2010-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 with some fancy scripting.
2010-01-18T10:10:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	care to point me in the right direction?
2010-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 and creative use of the find command.
2010-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	prolly faster to do it 1 by one then learn how to write bash scripts
2010-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 yep.  depends on your needs.. you go 10 to do.. or 10,0000
2010-01-21T06:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 theres some fsck option to answer yes to everything.. (use with caution)
2010-01-21T06:07:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	i think its to late
2010-01-21T06:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 proberly not. hard to tell
2010-01-30T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 in the past ive had to enter the smb://ip#/sharename befor.. for some odd reason to get things to be seen
2010-01-30T11:19:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	got this error Error: Failed to mount Windows share
2010-01-30T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i always fall back tot eh command line to mount some shares.. the gnome file manager is a little weird at times
2010-01-30T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 are you SURE thats a proper share name?
2010-01-30T11:20:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	yup...
2010-01-30T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 check with the 'smbtree' and 'findsmb' commands
2010-01-30T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 nautilus mounts them automacally under the .gvfs stuff.. i doub tif its the issue
2010-01-30T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 yep. i see similer issues on windows machines.
2010-01-30T11:21:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	what do u think it is
2010-01-30T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i often edit my /etc/hosts to have the proper ip/machine name. and enable the 'wins' server in my smb.conf  seems to help
2010-01-30T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	i think its windows being stupid really....
2010-01-30T11:22:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	I'm not using windows...lol I am using samba but no windows computers on this network
2010-01-30T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 if uysing linux to linux - then NFS will be MUCH faster for file transfers
2010-01-30T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 enable the wins server feature perhaps - may help. and set the hosts file to map ip to hostname perhaps
2010-01-30T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 ive also noticed that some wireless routers block samba shareing
2010-01-30T11:24:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	both host and client are connected directly to router...
2010-02-01T06:45:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	is the man
2010-02-01T06:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 hit escape or q perhaps. The keybindings are customuizeable
2010-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i recall being able to change the binding in game via the tab key perhaps?
2010-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	I've searched all over the menu, cant find an option to quit or exit emu
2010-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i dont recall it being that hard.  been using make for years.. pretty sure its esc or Q. or q.
2010-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	lol thats whats so crazy, it should be simple.... I've tried esc, q, all the fkeys every key on my keyboard frankly
2010-02-01T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 i normally use the xmame, not sdlmamne. so could be some keyboard issue/maping issue
2010-02-01T06:50:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	xmame is available in repo?
2010-02-01T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 yep - ive used it befor
2010-02-01T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 http://mamedev.org/devwiki/index.php/FAQ:Controls#How_do_I_configure_the_keys.3F
2010-02-01T06:51:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	found it, tried it and it works... as usual you solved my problem... you are the man. Thanks :)
2010-02-01T06:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 you had to hit escape fast or somthnig? :)
2010-02-01T06:53:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	i dunno i guess sdlmame keybindings are different, xmame worked. I'm using a UK keyboard atm while configuring the box that could have also contributed to the issue
2010-02-01T06:54:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	I'll stick around and try to take care of some low hanging fruit issues with ya... you've helped me so much recently. its the least i can do
2010-02-03T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 I could see where that could break things very badly.
2010-02-03T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 why not a buton to fix 'everything' :)
2010-02-03T06:27:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	lol why not?
2010-02-03T06:27:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	if contextual search ever pans out, and ubuntu standardizes some stuff and the forums, why wouldnt that be possible?
2010-02-04T07:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 You would have to find some sort of OS-X mount ssh server as a directory feature.      Or find a scp gui client for OS-X perhaps
2010-02-04T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 perhaps ask in #os-x
2010-02-15T07:25:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	You are basically the Mod here right?
2010-02-15T07:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Nope. I just dont have a life. Ops live in #ubuntu-ops
2010-02-15T07:26:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	lol, well user GLA needs to speak with one of the Wizards
2010-02-16T07:00:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	can u help?
2010-02-16T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 ive missed the problem.
2010-02-16T07:00:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	test disk is not picking up a drive that is totally screwed up.... Disk Utility does find it but it wont show up in testdisk...any help?? Please!
2010-02-16T07:01:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	is there way to tell testdsk to check /dev/sdb for example?
2010-02-16T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 ive not used testdisk enough to even rember its syntax
2010-02-16T07:01:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	thats my issue i think...
2010-02-16T07:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Looking at testdisk --help -> it can take a 'device'
2010-02-16T07:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 What fileysstem is the disk anyway?
2010-02-16T07:04:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	it doesn't, it doesnt allow me to point to to the location
2010-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	it's a Scsi NTFS
2010-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 you are not using /dev/sda when it should be /dev/sda1 ?
2010-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	the filesystem is so corrupted it wont goto /dev/sda1
2010-02-16T07:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 or i may have that backwards  may need to be sda instead of sda1
2010-02-16T07:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 Not sure what else to try. Ive rarely done much disk recovery.
2010-02-16T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 you could try to 'ddrescue' it to a file and try to recover files from that imagefile
2010-02-16T07:07:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	ill look into thanks!
2010-02-21T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 it puts stuff in the .wine dir  clean it out start from scratch :)
2010-02-21T13:50:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	i've got a bunch of stuff installed, will i have to re-install everything?
2010-02-21T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 for wine.. yep.. depending on what you delete.
2010-02-21T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 you can have seperate .wine directories for diffrent apps if needed
2010-02-21T13:51:00.000Z	rahduke	Dr_Willis	so your saying delete everything in the .wine folder? including drive_c and stuff?
2010-02-21T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rahduke	 or just move .wine to .wine_old      so you can toy with it
