2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	Schuenemann		chmod 644 -R /home/otto
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	Schuenemann		ok
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	don't do that
2009-02-04T03:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	make your home dir 755 for starters (non-recursive)
2009-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	after what you've already done, i'd say yes
2009-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	at least the directories
2009-02-04T03:56:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	this will change only the directories: find "$HOME" -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
2009-02-04T03:56:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	I already did to everything. Seems ok now
2009-02-04T03:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	now all your files are executable
2009-02-04T03:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	no. you can go through the files you don't want to be executable and make them 644
2009-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	maybe I should set everything back to 664 and then 755 to directories?
2009-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	that would have the same effect, yes
2009-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	that command you told me will do it for directories?
2009-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	yes
2009-02-04T04:02:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	things are messed. I see a lot of ??? instead of information if I do a ls -la $HOME
2009-02-04T04:03:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	chmod only lasts for the terminal session?
2009-02-04T04:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	hmm
2009-02-04T04:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	no, chmod is permanent
2009-02-04T04:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	so what's going on?
2009-02-04T04:07:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	I'm at $HOME. I do chmod 644 -R .  -- I get "cannot access '.' : permission denied
2009-02-04T04:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	get out of your home, and 'ls -ld /home/youruser'
2009-02-04T04:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	wjat
2009-02-04T04:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	what's the output of that?
2009-02-04T04:09:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	let me join IRC with that computer so I can paste it here. breb
2009-02-04T04:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	who owns it, and what are the permissions?
2009-02-04T04:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	select it and middle click in the irc client
2009-02-04T04:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	now do what you were going to do (supercareful) from OUTSIDE the directory
2009-02-04T04:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	the permissions
2009-02-04T04:16:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 http://pastebin.com/m6f5bdeb3 there
2009-02-04T04:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	ok, so everything is 755
2009-02-04T04:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	this is probably going to be fine.
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 ok, I'll try
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	don't run any commands
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	no
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 but everything is executable
2009-02-04T04:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	all it means is that your common text files, etc. are all marked executable
2009-02-04T04:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	this will make all regular files non-executable: find "$HOME" -type f -exec chmod -x {} \;
2009-02-04T04:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	you need directories to be executable in order to access their contents
2009-02-04T04:21:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 it's over
2009-02-04T04:21:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	as in ... ok?
2009-02-04T04:22:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 no, as in the command finished heh. No output. How to check if it's ok?
2009-02-04T04:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	see if you can access files and directories normally
2009-02-04T04:22:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 I think it's ok. I can access dirs and regular files aren't executable
2009-02-04T04:22:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 thank you very much
2009-02-04T04:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	now you know: 'chmod -R' can be VERY destructive
2009-02-04T04:23:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 yeah, anything -R can, I guess
2009-02-04T04:23:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	true
2009-02-04T04:25:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 now I'm back at the original problem: not being able to start gnome normally :D
2009-02-04T04:25:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	what's the problem?
2009-02-04T04:25:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 I described here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6653770
2009-02-04T04:26:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	this normally has to do with the .ICEauthority file in your homedir
2009-02-04T04:27:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 it was, once. I deleted and it went fine, but then it started again and didn't solve anymore. This idea of sharing /home partition was really bad
2009-02-04T04:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	make sure it's owned by you, and chmod 600 ~/.ICEauthority
2009-02-04T04:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	you may even move it to somewhere else (as backup) and i think it will be recreated
2009-02-04T04:28:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 -rw------- 1 otto otto 7963 2009-02-03 19:58 .ICEauthority   it's like this now
2009-02-04T04:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	that's good
2009-02-04T04:31:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 the idea of sharing home dir was suggested by slackware installation. It seems it sucks, though
2009-02-04T04:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	you should be able to get it to work. i see you changed your UID and GID
2009-02-04T04:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	are you able to sudo normally now?
2009-02-04T04:33:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 yeah, it made it work at that time. But then it happened again
2009-02-04T04:33:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 yes. Everything looks fine, except that first login option does not work
2009-02-04T04:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	i see you have fluxbox. does fluxbox work properly for both distros?
2009-02-04T04:36:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 only slackware has it. It's working fine
2009-02-04T04:36:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 ubuntu and fedora have gnome, slackware has fluxbox and debian has none yet
2009-02-04T04:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	i'd look around the web. there's others who have had your problem. Eg: google sharing /home directory many distros .ICEauthority
2009-02-04T04:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	there's a few threads with people with your problem. careful with all the random crap code that's out there.
2009-02-04T04:42:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 I found a lot of entries for that error message, but none about having many distros
2009-02-04T04:42:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 haha yeah. After this last one I ran, I'll be a lot more careful from now
2009-02-04T04:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	that google search i pasted will show you some people with your problem
2009-02-04T04:44:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 it's weird only ubuntu has problems with that
2009-02-04T04:44:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	accessing data files should be easy across distros. it's the stupid dotfiles for applications/desktop environments that's a pain
2009-02-04T04:48:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 what is the difference between choosing GNOME or that first option (Xclient something)? Perhaps it's not even worth looking so much for a solution if GNOME still logs in
2009-02-04T04:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	first option of what
2009-02-04T04:48:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 session type
2009-02-04T04:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	different desktop environments
2009-02-04T04:49:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 what changes? I don't remember anything different
2009-02-04T04:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	nothing all that important. mostly cosmetic stuff, some keyboard shortcuts...
2009-02-04T04:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	it's important to some people, but you don't seem to care. try installing fluxbox in ubuntu and see if it works
2009-02-04T04:51:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 why? just to test?
2009-02-04T04:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	well, if you don't care about running gnome, and gnome is the one causing a problem ...
2009-02-04T04:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	a lazy "fix" would be just not to run gnome, unless you feel like troubleshooting it
2009-02-04T04:52:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 maybe I should install ubuntu again
2009-02-04T04:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	i wouldn't
2009-02-04T04:53:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 it would reinstall ubuntu...
2009-02-04T04:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	what would?
2009-02-04T04:54:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 sorry, I mean it would reinstall gnome
2009-02-04T04:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	but why? there's probably nothing wrong with gnome. you just have to figure out how to get gnome to load properly across distros ... or use something else
2009-02-04T04:56:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 well, I guess I'll stick with the session type I'm using. If things get worse (like when I install a desktop environment for debian), I'll give up this idea of sharing /home
2009-02-04T05:19:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 that's he-man's cartoon
2009-02-04T05:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	i know. it's also what motu stands for (no joke)
2009-02-04T05:27:00.000Z	Schuenemann	prince_jammys	 is there voting for implementing confirm-before-delete for nautilus?
2009-02-04T05:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Schuenemann	haven't seen that. there probably is
