2012-04-24T06:56:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	did quake work on unity/class and no longer when you installed gnome-shell?
2012-04-24T06:56:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	correct
2012-04-24T06:57:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	have you checked the logs for any type of error , or possibly tried starting it from a terminal to debug the output?
2012-04-24T06:57:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I haven't, I will restart my machine and check for logs
2012-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	you can do that, you can also run quake from a terminal prompt and see if it gives any clues
2012-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I run guake manually and it works though. Keep that in mind
2012-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	interesting
2012-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	it just doesn't start - up
2012-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	ok, brb
2012-04-24T06:59:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	it is, it doesn't load with all other startup applications
2012-04-24T06:59:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	you mean to bring it down?
2012-04-24T06:59:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	no, it's F1
2012-04-24T07:00:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	the process is now running because I started it with Alt+F2
2012-04-24T07:00:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	it doesn't start on bootup
2012-04-24T07:01:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	ok, I'll be back,
2012-04-24T07:05:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	nope, didn't startup
2012-04-24T07:05:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	 1871 pts/0    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto guake
2012-04-24T07:06:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	maybe you can try to collect some details on the job and redirect it to a log on start up so you can get an idea of whats going on?
2012-04-24T07:06:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	how do I do that?
2012-04-24T07:07:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	oh boy, that's magic to me
2012-04-24T07:09:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	but you would want to make that your startup line, so you get it when the issue is occuring
2012-04-24T07:09:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I entered it into the terminal and guake started
2012-04-24T07:09:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	thats what we expected no? the issue you want to trace is startup
2012-04-24T07:10:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	so adjust your startup command to be that command posted last, and reboot
2012-04-24T07:10:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I see, brb then
2012-04-24T07:10:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	lets see the line before you go.. just in case
2012-04-24T07:11:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	 sudo strace -o /var/log/guake.log guake
2012-04-24T07:12:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	how about gksudo
2012-04-24T07:12:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I see
2012-04-24T07:13:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I can sudo without password, is that what you're asking about?
2012-04-24T07:14:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I always sudo visudo with NOPASSWD, I hate that password shit
2012-04-24T07:15:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	 lol
2012-04-24T07:15:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	 su laptop strace -o /var/log/guake.log guake ?
2012-04-24T07:17:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I'm confused now, please write the whole line
2012-04-24T07:17:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	as it should be
2012-04-24T07:18:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	yes
2012-04-24T07:19:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	ok, now reboot, brb
2012-04-24T07:24:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	so what now
2012-04-24T07:25:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	if its there and populated, take your time looking through it, if there is a obvious error you should see it, be wary of directory/file not found as it traverses your $PATH entries, those are somewhat normal
2012-04-24T07:25:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	let me see
2012-04-24T07:26:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	that thing has almost 13 thousand lines
2012-04-24T07:26:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	thats not surprising at all
2012-04-24T07:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	there are filters you can use to slim it up, but in this case, we dont know what the issue is so better to have it all
2012-04-24T07:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	some clever usage of grep and negation will help you
2012-04-24T07:27:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	Jesus, it will take me forever, and I don't even know what to look for
2012-04-24T07:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	^^
2012-04-24T07:28:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	what's that? : read(7, "timeError(\"Refusing to create an"..., 4096) = 3049
2012-04-24T07:29:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	laptop@ubuntu:/var/log$ cat guake.log | grep error
2012-04-24T07:31:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	it says IO Error, is that the case?
2012-04-24T07:33:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	no?
2012-04-24T07:34:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	one second.. looking something up for you..
2012-04-24T07:34:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	ok, I'm sorry
2012-04-24T07:37:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	hmmm, so should I do something to Python? Sounds like a story from zoo
2012-04-24T07:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	read(6, "error, \"unterminated name\"\n     "..., 4096) = 4096 it seems it hits this error in the python code before sys.exit is called (gracefully one would say) from python
2012-04-24T07:38:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	not sure if changing python is wise yet,, did something change with it and the update? or some dependant library?
2012-04-24T07:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	you can also google this and see if it is common
2012-04-24T07:41:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	but how come does guake start when called for from Alt+F2?
2012-04-24T07:41:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I guess I'm too dumb in this field.
2012-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	maybe it depends on something that is not available at the time it's being brought up?
2012-04-24T07:42:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	can I delay the startup ?
2012-04-24T07:43:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	i was actually going to say try that,, but it would be like "random" and it may not do anything at all
2012-04-24T07:43:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	let's delay it for 10s, what would be the spell?
2012-04-24T07:44:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	Ok, let me reboot, let's see.
2012-04-24T07:54:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	nope
2012-04-24T07:54:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	hmph
2012-04-24T07:55:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	Ok, no worries, I thank you for the time you sacrificed here for me.
2012-04-24T07:55:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	well that wasn't really any type of good solution anyway the sleep thing
2012-04-24T07:55:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	no worries
2012-04-24T07:55:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	save your log. if you find its a legitimate issue, maybe you can use it to file a report with the guake team
2012-04-24T07:55:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I know, I just hung upon that thing where you said it maybe depended on something that started up later.
2012-04-24T07:55:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I will
2012-04-24T07:56:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	that still may be the case
2012-04-24T07:56:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	sometimes sleep won't cut it,, especially with upstart and such starting things asynch
2012-04-24T07:59:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	where did you learn all that stuff?
2012-04-24T08:01:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	been an admin/engineer for a few years, now i automate these things
2012-04-24T08:01:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	lol, maybe, you're good though
2012-04-24T08:02:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	thanks a lot ;>
2012-04-24T08:02:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I should be thanking you.
2012-04-24T08:03:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I'll find another terminal that will work, I think terminator can do slide down too...
2012-04-24T08:04:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	im sure there are alternatives,, terminator is my fav at the moment it doesn't do slide down, i swear i recall some drawn out process of making it seem like it did though,, thats most likely invalidated by unity/gnome-shell (this was back in the day)
2012-04-24T08:04:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	aaah, I see
2012-04-24T08:05:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	another thing you can try is to look for an updated package or such like check your version and see if the dev's have a later stable version with bug fixes etc
2012-04-24T08:06:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	let me do that now
2012-04-24T08:07:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	is there a shortcut "about" kind of thing in terminal I can run to look at any application that's installed? Or do I have to do apt-cache?
2012-04-24T08:08:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	apt-cache show
2012-04-24T08:08:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	worked lol
2012-04-24T08:12:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	^^
2012-04-24T08:13:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	awesome
2012-04-24T08:14:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	can I somehow return the favor for your help?
2012-04-24T08:14:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	naryfa	nah - im used to support and stuff no sweat at all - i fear to say i like to help people?
2012-04-24T08:22:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	I installed tilda terminal, let's see if this one will startup , brb
2012-04-24T08:29:00.000Z	naryfa	SolarisBoy	this one works perfectly
