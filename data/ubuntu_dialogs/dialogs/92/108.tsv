2005-12-24T08:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	There might be some differences in default other programs too.
2006-01-16T17:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	hardinfo will probably be what you're looking for.
2006-01-27T07:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	nvu.
2006-01-27T07:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Of course.
2006-01-27T07:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	^^
2006-01-27T07:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	You'll have to resize the Windows one first.
2006-01-27T07:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	The install CD lets you do that safely.  (I'm assuming WinXP is already on the computer and Ubuntu's what you want to add now.)
2006-01-27T07:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Am I correct in thinking what you mean is you've already attempted the install CD, and you got this message then?
2006-01-27T07:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Sounds like a good recommendation to me.  I'm liking it a lot so far.
2006-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	And Windows is currently hogging ALL of it.
2006-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	First, boot Windows and run the disk defragmenter.  (Start > Programs > Applications > System Tools > Degragment)
2006-01-27T07:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Windows doesn't need it all, but uses it all by default.
2006-01-27T07:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	When you get to the partioning part, select Manually edit hte partition table.
2006-01-27T07:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	After that resize you should be able to make partitions for Ubuntu just fine.
2006-01-27T07:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Nope.  Just choose which one to change.
2006-01-27T07:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	I've also heard that Dreamweaver might run with wine, but that's a bit sketchy.
2006-01-27T07:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	nvu.com, evaluate that for yourself.
2006-01-27T13:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	It sounds like that could be what you need?
2006-01-28T13:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	By default there is no root password; use sudo.
2006-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	So don't su root.
2006-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	sudo -i.
2006-02-20T08:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Either watch the language or have someone watch it for you.
2006-03-19T07:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	tell mike_ about mp3
2006-03-24T11:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Hi.
2006-04-06T08:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	You can apt-get things on a Live CD, but they'll eat your RAM.
2006-04-08T13:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Hi.
2006-04-08T13:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	have a look at my post please
2006-04-08T13:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Are you trying to partition a mounted filesystem?
2006-04-08T13:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Could you restate it?  I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding what you wrote.
2006-04-08T14:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	First, is there enough free space to do the resize?
2006-04-08T14:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	/dev/hda1  size is 38153   used 4279  unused  33875
2006-04-08T14:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Man.  Um, have you tried doing it from cli to see what other messages might exist?
2006-04-08T14:07:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	no please make some suggestions
2006-04-08T14:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	I haven't actually done this myself, but you'll be looking into the 'parted' utility.  Read the --help and man first, and see what you can come up with.  I wish I could help further, but I'm starting to be at a loss.  Save whatever data you get and pastebin it; hopefully someone will know what's going on.
2006-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	is parted part of gparted? j
2006-04-08T14:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	parted is the cli tool; gparted is a GUI interface to it.
2006-04-08T14:12:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	o k bit slow today day off work
2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	thanks for your help  read man file not many options that would make a pate understandable linux is a chanellenge
2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	True.  Try again at different times of day; someone's bound to know.
2006-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	yep but roryy was the man
2006-04-08T14:20:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	are you familiar with dsmeg command
2006-04-08T14:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Nope.
2006-04-13T12:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Care to share that page, btw?
2006-12-06T09:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	You might consider changing your nick to something more personal (since it's default it can get confusing)
2007-01-16T09:45:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	hey
2007-01-23T08:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Don't know why
2007-02-28T10:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Gnome comes by default - what do you mean?

2007-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	That doesn't make any sense.  It's installed by default out of the box.
2007-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	have you searched the bug?
2007-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	no

2007-02-28T11:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	You're searching for whether someone else has reported a possible fix.
2007-02-28T11:09:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	 ok

2007-02-28T11:18:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	 aha ok .
2007-02-28T11:25:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	how to reinstall gnome
2007-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	ubuntu	tonyyarusso	hey why webmin is not supported .
2007-08-20T11:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	If you have a question, please ask it succinctly and in a readable fashion, on one line.
2007-08-20T11:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	What is your native language?
2007-08-20T11:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Gutsy is not yet released.
2007-08-20T11:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	October
2007-08-20T12:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	as this is a support channel, we don't really need to know all of your system specs unless they are directly related to a support channel.  For general chit-chat, try #ubuntu-offtopic please.
2008-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	You need to designate a partition to be "/"
2008-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Which partitioning option are you using?
2008-04-30T06:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Yours is already taken though, as you might expect.
2010-02-04T09:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	yes
2010-02-05T20:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	read-write
2010-02-05T20:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	rw only means that *someone* can write to it, not necessarily you.
2011-03-24T07:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Do you see the link ubottu gave you (twice)?  That's how.
2011-11-03T12:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	Do you want to know how to like boot, or actually boot?
2011-11-03T12:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ubuntu	it should be an option on your grub menu during the boot sequence - just arrow down to it.
