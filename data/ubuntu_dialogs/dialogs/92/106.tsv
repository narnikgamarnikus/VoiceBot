2008-05-26T03:05:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 desktop

2008-05-26T03:14:00.000Z	james__	vlad	audio chip appears to be azalia
2008-05-26T03:19:00.000Z	james__	vlad	 sudo modprobe -c | grep hda (pastebin
2008-05-26T03:21:00.000Z	james__	vlad	also, what the model of your mother board
2008-05-26T03:23:00.000Z	vlad	james__	http://pastebin.org/38490 and mobo gigabyte  GA-MA770-DS3
2008-05-26T03:25:00.000Z	james__	vlad	it appears that azalia audio is a joint effort for HD Audio standards from Intel and a few others, the issue is that the intel module may not work... I'm researching this further
2008-05-26T03:25:00.000Z	james__	vlad	this is odd as you seem to have an AMD platform
2008-05-26T03:26:00.000Z	vlad	james__	yes man amd, so its like a bug or smth?
2008-05-26T03:27:00.000Z	james__	vlad	not a bug per say, but it may actually be and INTEL driver or and ATI driver that you need... not sure yet
2008-05-26T03:28:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 oic
2008-05-26T03:28:00.000Z	james__	vlad	start here
2008-05-26T03:28:00.000Z	james__	vlad	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=181186
2008-05-26T03:29:00.000Z	james__	vlad	and here http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page
2008-05-26T03:29:00.000Z	vlad	james__	man my sounds works but just 2.1 even if the sound is 5.1
2008-05-26T03:30:00.000Z	james__	vlad	then you may have a generic driver that doesn't support 5.1
2008-05-26T03:30:00.000Z	james__	vlad	or you may need additional modules
2008-05-26T03:30:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 its a driver i just download from synaptic
2008-05-26T03:31:00.000Z	james__	vlad	please search over the alsa website to verify you have the right modules
2008-05-26T03:32:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 yes man this are exactly the dirvers i have
2008-05-26T03:33:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 version 16
2008-05-26T03:33:00.000Z	james__	vlad	the more I think about this, the more I wonder if you need the development modules from the backports repos
2008-05-26T03:34:00.000Z	james__	vlad	there may also be an additional Gui to enable 5.1
2008-05-26T03:34:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 im noob :)
2008-05-26T03:35:00.000Z	james__	vlad	imma ask mib
2008-05-26T03:36:00.000Z	james__	vlad	keep in mind that if we add the backports, (experimental) you're on your own if it doesn't work
2008-05-26T03:37:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 im downloading the ones from that alsa page mines said after the numbers -generic
2008-05-26T03:37:00.000Z	james__	vlad	basically, the backports would allow you to install the experimental version of the Azalia driver via synaptic, likely the generic ones don't work
2008-05-26T03:39:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 im installing the drivers from the page, can u tell me what else i need from there?
2008-05-26T03:39:00.000Z	james__	vlad	that's just it, you need different drivers entirely. How much work are you willing to do to get HD 5.1 working vs 2.1?
2008-05-26T03:40:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 i see too many movies that are in 5.1
2008-05-26T03:41:00.000Z	james__	vlad	see mib_ih7x99  post for backports info
2008-05-26T03:42:00.000Z	james__	vlad	you need deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hardy-backports main universe multiverse restricted
2008-05-26T03:42:00.000Z	james__	vlad	add this to your repos
2008-05-26T03:44:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 how to add this?
2008-05-26T03:45:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 just make make install them?
2008-05-26T03:48:00.000Z	vlad	james__	u there?
2008-05-26T03:54:00.000Z	vlad	james__	hey man still here?
2008-05-26T04:00:00.000Z	james__	vlad	still here?
2008-05-26T04:01:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 yes im still here :)
2008-05-26T04:01:00.000Z	james__	vlad	have you added the backports to your sources list?
2008-05-26T04:02:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 dunno how to add them i downloaded 2 packages 1 for universal other for multiuniversal from the page u gave me
2008-05-26T04:02:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 both seems to be the same and are like txt files
2008-05-26T04:03:00.000Z	james__	vlad	please explain
2008-05-26T04:06:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 i went to the page u gave me then enter to i386 for hardy then downloaded Packages.bz2 when i extract it there is a file "packages" that i open with gedit
2008-05-26T04:09:00.000Z	vlad	james__	?
2008-05-26T04:21:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 are u there?
2008-05-26T04:34:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 u there?
2008-05-27T00:14:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 hey u there?
2008-05-27T00:14:00.000Z	james__	vlad	hey man
2008-05-27T00:15:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 man i could find the 5.1 sound, but now i have new prob why moves looks soo poor video, it can be original dvd or any dvd rip are some pixels there
2008-05-27T00:15:00.000Z	james__	vlad	are you using protected video?
2008-05-27T00:16:00.000Z	james__	vlad	also, what did you find the issue was with the 5.1 channel sound?>
2008-05-27T00:17:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 the issue was i hav to check something in vlc so its good now, with mplayer no but im ok with vlc and protected video no and still with avis
2008-05-27T00:19:00.000Z	james__	vlad	where do you get your video? What are the formats you are trying to play? And are you using restricted drivers?
2008-05-27T00:20:00.000Z	vlad	james__	yes are restricted dirvers, compiz works so good and the movies can be legit dvd, avi ripped from dvd or any video looks pixelated, even the subtitles
2008-05-27T00:21:00.000Z	james__	vlad	please disable compiz, and tell me if you get the same result
2008-05-27T00:22:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 yes man same problem without compiz
2008-05-27T00:22:00.000Z	james__	vlad	what about movie player?
2008-05-27T00:24:00.000Z	vlad	james__	moovieplayer even more pixelated than vlc
2008-05-27T00:25:00.000Z	vlad	james__	for some reason automatic updates ask me to get a new vid driver, maybe that fix the problem
2008-05-27T00:26:00.000Z	james__	vlad	possibly, but doubtful. Without seeing the video play, I can't be certain if it's a driver or Codec issue. I would upgrade the video driver, and then play around with codecs
2008-05-27T00:27:00.000Z	vlad	james__	which codecs do u use to watch movies?
2008-05-27T00:28:00.000Z	james__	vlad	just the standard libxine-1 and ffmpeg
2008-05-27T00:30:00.000Z	james__	vlad	system/administration/hardware testing and test your video
2008-05-27T00:30:00.000Z	vlad	james__	going to check if i have those
2008-05-27T00:32:00.000Z	james__	vlad	system/preferences/screen resolution
2008-05-27T00:33:00.000Z	james__	vlad	try using 1024x768
2008-05-27T00:34:00.000Z	vlad	james__	same error man
2008-05-27T00:34:00.000Z	james__	vlad	what video card do you have?
2008-05-27T00:34:00.000Z	vlad	james__	radeon x1300
2008-05-27T00:34:00.000Z	vlad	james__	radeon x1550 which is the same
2008-05-27T00:35:00.000Z	james__	vlad	do what?
2008-05-27T00:35:00.000Z	vlad	james__	do what?
2008-05-27T00:36:00.000Z	james__	vlad	is that just the video card or is it also a capture card/tv tuner?
2008-05-27T00:36:00.000Z	vlad	james__	just video card
2008-05-27T00:45:00.000Z	vlad	james__	 still there? :D
