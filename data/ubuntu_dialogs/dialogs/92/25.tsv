2010-05-05T10:29:00.000Z	cdw32		Hello all ! I recently install 10.04 like most of you and ihave been having a problem with my graphics card. Any thoughs?
2010-05-05T10:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	details pls when asking
2010-05-05T10:30:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	well my videos are very choppy and the audio and visual tracks do not match up
2010-05-05T10:31:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	and and the visual reactions are not fluid. if that makes sense
2010-05-05T10:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	what hardware, using compiz, did it work before your upgrade, etc.
2010-05-05T10:32:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i know its from intel on a dell mini 12 and yes it did. my buddy thinks its the driver...
2010-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i ran the lspci in terminal and it didnt give me anyything i understood
2010-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	probably, try in a terminal: lspci | grep VGA
2010-05-05T10:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	 what do you get?
2010-05-05T10:34:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation System Controller Hub (SCH Poulsbo) Graphics Controller (rev 06)
2010-05-05T10:38:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i checked the intel website and they do not have linux drivers
2010-05-05T10:39:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	that's ok. Look in System>Admin...>Harware Drivers - see what's there
2010-05-05T10:39:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	just wireless driver
2010-05-05T10:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	hmm What Dell do you have?
2010-05-05T10:43:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	inspiron 1210
2010-05-05T10:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	oh, laptop!
2010-05-05T10:44:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	lol
2010-05-05T10:47:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i have no clue what to do anymore
2010-05-05T10:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	you said that videos flicker, right?
2010-05-05T10:50:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	yes  have you ever seen a computer on television and it flickers...thats what the video on my computer looks liek
2010-05-05T10:50:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	what about everything else? Okay, or not - if yes what videos, youtube?
2010-05-05T10:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	oh, your entire screen is doing this?
2010-05-05T10:51:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	no
2010-05-05T10:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	what about everything else? Okay, or not - if yes what videos, youtube?
2010-05-05T10:53:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	ah, did you install ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
2010-05-05T10:53:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	how would one do that
2010-05-05T10:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	I'm not saying it will fix your issue, but sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-05-05T10:58:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	it said that it couldnt find the package
2010-05-05T10:59:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	should be: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras - that should have worked
2010-05-05T11:00:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	no it did i tried three times.
2010-05-05T11:03:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	this http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/428094/
2010-05-05T11:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	looks like you need this one: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main universe restricted multiverse
2010-05-05T11:09:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i did it second time and its working should i still do what you just sent
2010-05-05T11:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	no
2010-05-05T11:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	did you buy your pc from dell?
2010-05-05T11:10:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	yes i did
2010-05-05T11:11:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	maybe you can contact them regarding your video issue as well. I think Dell sells PCs with ubuntu installed - I could be wrong.
2010-05-05T11:12:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	yes they sold this to me with ubuntu 8.04 on it....
2010-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	the restricted extras might help right
2010-05-05T11:13:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	Dells page doesn't mention Linux/Ubuntu anywhere?
2010-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	ubuntu.dell.com
2010-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	they sold it to me like this and i think they are kicking themselves for it
2010-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	heh :)
2010-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	and dell dose not have any support with ubuntu you have to to call cononical
2010-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	fair enough
2010-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i dont know
2010-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	once this is done the extras is there anything i need to do
2010-05-05T11:17:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	the restricted extras will provide the codecs and what not that ubuntu can't legally package into their OS - some legal thing, go figure. I think I read somewhere that Mint includes them though.
2010-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	mint
2010-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	no you shouldn't have to restart. Mint / ubuntu derivitive(?)
2010-05-05T11:18:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	I don't mint...
2010-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i have no clue what is it
2010-05-05T11:19:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	I have heard about issues with flash a lot here lately, that's why I asked what videos you were having issues with.
2010-05-05T11:20:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	all of them
2010-05-05T11:22:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	so i may never have good vid again
2010-05-05T11:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	not true, you just need to keep at it. There are several layers that have to work together for your video to be solid. You may have to addess each of them - don't know.
2010-05-05T11:24:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	thats the think i have no clue what the layers are lol
2010-05-05T11:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	np problem, you should do this... Boot into your BIOS, see if it tells you *exactly* what video adapter is installed. Write that down, it will go a long way for getting it set up right.
2010-05-05T11:27:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	is there a command or something i have to run
2010-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	for what?
2010-05-05T11:28:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	to find out what vga componant is installed
2010-05-05T11:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	well you ran lspci, you could try this: sudo lshw, but I don't think it's going to give you anything more.
2010-05-05T11:31:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i meant in bios is there anything i need to do
2010-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	no, when you power on it should be F2 as it comes up to get into the BIOS
2010-05-05T11:32:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	power up hit F2 once a sec or so as it powers up.
2010-05-05T11:33:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	f2 is the options isnt it
2010-05-05T11:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	do this, open up a new terminal, then run: dmesg > dmesg.txt - and paste the entire thing.
2010-05-05T11:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	to pastbin, that is...It'll tell what driver is being loaded.
2010-05-05T11:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	there will be a file called dmesg.txt in you home directory...
2010-05-05T11:36:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	can you send that to me again pls
2010-05-05T11:36:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	do this, open up a new terminal, then run: dmesg > dmesg.txt - and paste the entire thing.
2010-05-05T11:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	there will be a file called dmesg.txt in you home directory...
2010-05-05T11:39:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	here you go http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/428114/
2010-05-05T11:39:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	looking, brb
2010-05-05T11:41:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i will be right back...
2010-05-05T11:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	there?
2010-05-05T11:50:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	im back

2010-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	yeah, wierd would you paste the output of: lspci | grep VGA - here please
2010-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	should only be one line
2010-05-05T11:54:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation System Controller Hub (SCH Poulsbo) Graphics Controller (rev 06)
2010-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	great 00:02.0, that's what I needed, ty
2010-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	what does that mean
2010-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	is there anything i can do to help
2010-05-05T12:06:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	no, I'm a bit dissappointed, that's all. There are a number of things that can probably be done, but I have to get some sleep now. I am sorry, but maybe someone else here can help. Again, sorry man.
2010-05-05T12:06:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	 thats cool
2010-05-05T12:06:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i feel the same what
2010-05-05T12:07:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	i am still trying to understand linux
2010-05-05T12:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	good luck, but it's not anyones fault, Your harware is "difficult", and not a lot in the way of help on Google. You have to promise to post the fix - should you get it - to the forums so others can benefit, ok.
2010-05-05T12:08:00.000Z	cdw32	greezmunkey	yeah thanks will do...i have been blowing google up the past days
2010-05-05T12:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cdw32	no doubt, g'night.
