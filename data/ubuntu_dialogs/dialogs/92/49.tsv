2008-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	noob-africa		so much for K3b!
2008-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	noob-africa		now, where do i find  the correct serial number for Nero Linux 3? the download is only good for 15 days!
2008-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	I'd imagine you send some cash to ahead
2008-04-04T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	try sudo modprobe usb-storage
2008-04-04T14:26:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	modprobe produces no results
2008-04-04T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	good. then if you fdisk -l you should see the /dev that points to the stick
2008-04-04T14:28:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	error produced > Disk /dev/sdc doesn't contain a valid partition table
2008-04-04T14:29:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	the flash disk has some key data that someone wants to retrieve... <I> didnt remove it improperly from the Windows PC that was accessing it
2008-04-04T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	if the data is there then its fine. you need to find the /dev that points to it so we can mount it
2008-04-04T14:31:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	the fdisk command produced this report > Disk /dev/sdc doesn't contain a valid partition table
2008-04-04T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	ahhhh. What if you put it in the first system?
2008-04-04T14:31:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	how?
2008-04-04T14:32:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	u mean the windows PC? it's a laptop, and not located within this building... it's somewhere several kilometres away
2008-04-04T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	hmm, got a windows pc?
2008-04-04T14:33:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	do u suggest we put it in a different PC?
2008-04-04T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	yeah cos it might be able to chkdsk/f the disk and repair it
2008-04-04T14:41:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	guess what... we put the flash on my neighbour's PC... it says the disk in drive F is not formatted!
2008-04-04T14:41:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	i guess this is the reward one gets for using Windows! data loss!
2008-04-04T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	run some data recoveryon it
2008-04-04T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	what format was the drive?
2008-04-04T14:50:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	NTFS
2008-04-04T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	just googling a solution. you got a backup of the data?
2008-04-04T14:52:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	on the flash? i doubt it...
2008-04-04T14:52:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	how would i do a data recovery on it, other than with testdisk? testdisk cant do any data recovery on the flash
2008-04-04T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	http://onlyubuntu.blogspot.com/2007/05/recover-data-from-damaged-hard-disk.html looks good :)

2008-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	I have a network problem here where I am, MSN Messenger account keeps going offline... Yahoo Messenger account is stable
2008-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	thats because they use different protocol
2008-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	noob-africa	you could create a group and drag all your buddies to one group
2008-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	noob-africa	ActionParsnip	apparently there is a Yahoo Messenger 1.0.4 for Linux
