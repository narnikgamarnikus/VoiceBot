2010-06-17T18:23:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	i suggest using it on 10.04 preferably
2010-06-17T18:24:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	bah they dont test enough with older ones i think ,\
2010-06-17T18:24:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	stick with defaults for 9.04
2010-06-17T18:24:00.000Z	Cavej03	indus	10.04 has been causing me problems remember and I just wiped 10.4 from my system
2010-06-17T18:24:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	anyways you can try cos you have a specific issue
2010-06-17T18:28:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	ambient , light and dark,
2010-06-17T18:28:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	ah ambiance yes
2010-06-17T18:33:00.000Z	Cavej03	indus	so just sh the ati drivers indus? and then what command after?
2010-06-17T18:33:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	sudo sh drivername
2010-06-17T18:34:00.000Z	indus	Cavej03	yes thats all and finally yes aticonfig --initial , but thats because i find that i dont get a display on reboot without it
