2007-06-07T05:09:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		does ubuntu have apps like poweriso that allows me to mount virtual drives
2007-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		huh!! private message, sorry how cna i even see private messages
2007-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		I seriously new, im still using this OS as if i was using Win XP
2007-06-07T05:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	you can mount isos dircetly in linux
2007-06-07T05:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	yes, users only have rights over her home (security). Use sudo
2007-06-07T05:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	example 'sudo mkdir /media/iso_images'
2007-06-07T05:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	so you have. you can use sudo. other users can not use sudo
2007-06-07T05:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	that would be a security risk... if you have to use sudo you will be more carefull on what you do and will not make as many mistakes as you will otherwise do (trust me ;))
2007-06-07T05:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	sudo mount -o loop smooth-express-2.0-spl.iso media/iso_image  <<< that's how it is done
2007-06-07T11:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	have you tried System>Admin>Printers to add your printer??

2007-06-07T11:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	http://www.openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Canon-i350 <<< it seems that you will have to work a little to make your printer work in linux :(
2007-06-25T13:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	d4x (gui) or axel (cli)
2007-06-25T13:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	I think ive got d4x havent tested it yet and ill look for axel... thanx for the info
2007-06-25T13:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	no problem
2008-04-02T01:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	intrepid ibex
2008-10-24T00:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	man script
2008-10-24T00:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	ty but it seems i have to run that all the time, im looking for something like in xterm that logs everything i do on every login
2008-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	sudo mount -a -o remount
2008-10-24T01:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	no problem
2008-10-24T01:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	remounting the filesystems make them use the new options on /etc/fstab iirc i do not see the need for a reboot
2008-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	i tried your command but got that my drives couldnt be mounted, either in use (which they arent or bad command) do you suggest anything?
2008-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	:|
2008-10-24T01:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	so you have to reboot after all
2008-10-24T01:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	yah seems so :'(
2009-07-05T21:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	split the file beforehand
2009-07-05T21:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	i know i could do that but isn't there a way to just do it without having to split the files manually?
2009-09-14T02:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	a little of google-fu gives this --> http://www.rarewares.org/others.php#wavegain
2009-09-14T02:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	i went -- freshmeat --> that site
2009-09-14T02:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	awww didnt think of checking there thanks will use the file from the site
2009-10-23T02:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	but that was a month or so back....
2009-10-23T02:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	new version of pidgin (in backports) should have no problems now
2009-10-23T02:22:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	i am using the backport for hardy -  Installed: 1:2.5.2-0ubuntu1.2~hardy1, I am guessing your talking about jaunty/karmic?
2009-10-23T02:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	yep; iirc yahoo changed the protocol... maybe the pidgin homepage has info on what versions of pidgin are compatible with the new protocol
2009-10-23T02:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	seems you need at least 2.5.7 ... but double check it was just a quick googling
2009-10-23T02:25:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	no problem thanks to you I found out the ppa have the latest pidgin package wasn't even aware it had a ppa :s
2009-10-23T02:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	yup works like a charm thank you for the info
2009-10-23T02:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	no problem
2010-01-10T23:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	could you send me  a pm with a list of router orientated distro it might be what ive been looking for
2010-01-10T23:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	i just mentioned the two ones i know from the tip of my head. distrowatch and google should have a lot of more info
2010-01-10T23:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	ok
2010-05-02T02:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	is a basic vi ?
2010-05-02T02:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	its not vi none are being found im puzzled
2010-05-02T02:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_editor/BusyBox_vi <<< hw did you called it ?
2010-05-02T02:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	ok but how do i actually call forward the editor so I can edit the file because using vi foobar doesnt work
2010-05-02T19:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	there should be docs somewhere
2010-05-02T19:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	i know there should be somewhere,  its about where
2010-05-02T19:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt
2010-05-09T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	snort and wireshark are not the same type of software ....
2010-05-09T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	snort is an ids iirc wireshark is an sniffer
2010-05-09T16:46:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	hmmm... I need to go check what snort actually does and about wireshark can it be used in a server environment cli?
2010-05-09T16:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	wiresharc is gui but there are other sniffers that are cli; ettercap or tcpdump ...
2010-05-09T16:48:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	thanks a while back tcpdump came up while doing some network research, might have another look but did find that tshark seems to be the cli version of wireshark
2010-05-09T16:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	your choice
2010-05-09T16:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	true however I am going into the unknown unprepared and without a clue, it is so fun...
2010-05-09T16:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	##network ?
2010-05-09T16:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	hah this place has a channel for everything, might pop there later just doing some reading on the options available
2010-05-10T14:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	try autoremove after the purge
2010-05-10T14:49:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	if xorg is installed it wont autremove that but at least that's the least of my problems don't want libraries/packages lying about that arent needed, isn't there a more specific approach?
2010-05-10T14:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	dunno; see /var/log/apt/term.log ? remove packages ilisted there by hand ?
2010-05-10T14:53:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	thanks will do
2010-05-13T15:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	added the quota option to the fstab line ?
2010-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	yeah I did wasn't sure if should only be added to / on its own since its partitioned from /home so did it on both
2010-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	it still doesn't work either I need a hard reboot or its lvm causing the issue
2010-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	check the /proc/mounts and make sure it has quota as option
2010-05-13T15:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	hmmm just opened that file and for some strange reason it has noquota as an option, weird :s
2010-05-13T15:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	time to recheck /etc/fstab :)
2010-05-13T15:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	huh, its not listed in fstab but on that files was going to directly edit the file once I backed it up
2010-05-13T15:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	can you check something for me /proc/mounts is a simlink for /mounts so if that is so where is /mounts? Either my eyesight has gone worse or I can't find it in /
2010-05-13T15:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	is a symlink to /proc/self/mounts <---> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 2010-05-13 12:24 /proc/mounts -> self/mounts
2010-05-13T15:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	but that does not matter much; does it ?
2010-05-13T15:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	it does since I can't edit the file even as root, vi keeps telling me its read-only... so I was thinking of finding the actual file...
2010-05-13T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	you can not edit that file.... is informative just like /proc/cpuinfo or /proc/meminfo
2010-05-13T15:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	it shows what it is mounted and where. the file to modify is /etc/fstab
2010-05-13T15:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	yeah noticed that just need to work out why I can't use quota on my filesystem(s) since fstab is currently set to use quota
2010-05-13T15:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	that i dunno.... « dmesg | grep -i quota » ?
2010-05-13T15:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	no worries will struggle for a bit before I take a break, that command gave nada, just wondering would you know what the defaults option that gets written in fstab actually does, wondering if removing that would help, will test since I backed it up
2010-05-13T15:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	thanks for your time hope you have a nice day
2010-05-13T15:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	no problem. defaults gives what is default for that particular filesystem. check  « man mounts » some explain further some do not
2010-05-13T15:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	will do thanks
2010-05-13T18:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	shift
2010-05-13T18:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	guntbert: thanks
2010-06-19T15:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	dmesg | grep -iE '(atapi|dvd)'
2010-06-19T15:01:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	thanks
2010-07-05T01:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	from what i see here wubi instals are way to fragile. grub problems or corrupt image file are common. i do not recommend them
2010-07-05T01:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	so wouldn't I, I prefer to spend 30-45min installing from live cd than mess with wubi, saying it installs in windows itself doesn't it mean that it also suffers from NTFS fragmentation (this are all assumption based on my knowledge) which beats the point of having linux and how does one go about using chroot... too many question I need to explore
2010-07-17T02:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pirate_Hunter	probably works with hplip like most hp printers
2010-07-17T02:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	erUSUL	hplip... ? I assume I have to download that as well?
