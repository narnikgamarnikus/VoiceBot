2006-01-06T13:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	I'd be interested in the better way just out of curiosity if you care to give it.
2006-01-06T13:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	I'll test that in a minute.
2006-01-06T13:35:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	i'd like to know the better way too. I just know there's another one because that one is pretty ugly...
2006-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Ah.  Maybe I'll stumble across it.
2006-01-06T13:37:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	what about deleting /etc/rc3.d/S13gdm and changing the default init to 3 in /etc/inittab?
2006-01-06T13:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	That sounds like it would work.  Would have to try it.
2006-01-06T13:41:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	what did you tried?
2006-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	For some reason /etc/init.d/gdm start disables my console switching.
2006-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	So I'm actually still very much open to ideas.
2006-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Just restarted it outside of the boot sequence this time.
2006-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	so you can't change the TTY using Ctrl+Alt+F#?
2006-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Correct.
2006-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	do you spawn the ttys in inittab?
2006-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Don't know.
2006-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	and Kr0ntab: Once I'm logged in to the desktop, in gnome-terminal I can sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop.
2006-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	 something like '1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1' in /etc/inittab
2006-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	and Kr0ntab: I then have full ability to switch between my ttys.
2006-01-06T13:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	and Kr0ntab: I maintain that ability if I then startx from one of them, but not if I start gdm.
2006-01-06T13:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	I'll look for that.
2006-01-06T13:45:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	you should have them, because if not you couldn't switch even when disabling gdm
2006-01-06T13:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Ah.
2006-01-06T13:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Yeah, I spawn 1-6.
2006-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	then it should be somthing related to gdm alone...
2006-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	1 is :2345 while 2-6 are :23 only.
2006-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	the same as me...
2006-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	have you changed somthing in the gdm configuration?
2006-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	So then what?
2006-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	I don't think I even know how.
2006-01-06T13:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Someone suggested a driver conflict of some sort, but I wasn't able to pinpoint anything.
2006-01-06T13:48:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	i don't think it would be a driver conflict
2006-01-06T13:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	If you have any ideas of what it could be, please throw them out here, and maybe I'll find something useful.  Not sure where to even look myself.
2006-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	i'm reading the gdm.conf, in order to find if there's something that blocks the ctrl+alt+F1
2006-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Oh, I have a login theme installed, but that worked before this problem happened.
2006-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Okay.
2006-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	have you tried dpkg-reconfigure gdm, just in case that would change anything...
2006-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	No, I haven't.  Will do.
2006-01-06T13:54:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	and you can change to TTY doing a startx, a X& gnome-session, but you can't when you load the gdm first. Is that ok?
2006-01-06T13:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Can I do the reconfigure with it running, or should I stop it first?
2006-01-06T13:55:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	you should stop it, just in case it has to do something...
2006-01-06T13:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	What do you mean by X& gnome-session?  Haven't done that.
2006-01-06T13:56:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	with X& you load the xserver in the background, and with gnome-session, i'm not pretty sure (i used fluxbox), but you load the gnome desktop
2006-01-06T14:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	No go on X& gnome-session.
2006-01-06T14:27:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	what did he say?
2006-01-06T14:29:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	hmmm, then, to run gnome-desktop you have to run a different thing than gnome-session..
2006-01-06T14:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Sorry, ^^.
2006-01-06T14:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	gnome-session did exist though.
2006-01-06T14:31:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	instead of gnome-session run gnome-wm
2006-01-06T14:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Okay.
2006-01-06T14:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Same thing.
2006-01-06T14:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Still have yet to try dpkg-reconfigure gdm, should I do that now?
2006-01-06T14:36:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	try it, but i'm not sure it would help you
2006-01-06T14:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Okay.
2006-01-06T14:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Now I killed it.
2006-01-06T14:41:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	what?
2006-01-06T14:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	 * Reloading GNOME Display Manager configuration...
2006-01-06T14:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Now /etc/init.d/gdm failed completely.
2006-01-06T14:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	gdm start that is.
2006-01-06T14:42:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	what did you do?
2006-01-06T14:42:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	not, just gdm will work
2006-01-06T14:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm.
2006-01-06T14:43:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	woah, that killed gdm? that's pretty strange...
2006-01-06T14:44:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop; sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-01-06T14:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	nv.  Needed sudo.
2006-01-06T14:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	But it's scary-looking now.  My fonts, icons, and resolution are all different.
2006-01-06T14:46:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	hmm, and all because the dpkg-reconfigure... even the screen resolution?
2006-01-06T14:46:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	and it works to change to the TTYs?
2006-01-06T14:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	It seemed like it.  I didn't actually check in the res setup, but things were different sizes as if it were.
2006-01-06T14:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	No.  I had that start on display 2 while this was up, and had to kill it to get back here.
2006-01-06T14:48:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	i don't have a clue of what's happening...
2006-01-06T14:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Nuts.
2006-01-06T14:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Can I undo my reconfigure?
2006-01-06T14:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Or any clue about the part it said failed?
2006-01-06T14:52:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	i don't know, but i'm afraid that you can't
2006-01-06T14:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Shoot.
2006-01-06T14:53:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	what did fail?
2006-01-06T14:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	invoke-rc.d: initscript gdm, action "reload" failed.
2006-01-06T14:55:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	but that was performed when you did a dpkg-reconfigure or when tried sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop; sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start ?
2006-01-06T14:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm, in that part's output.
2006-01-06T14:57:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	see the /var/log/dpkg.log for some info about why it failed
2006-01-06T14:58:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	or use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste the whole file
2006-01-06T14:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Um, the file's empty.
2006-01-06T14:59:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	that's good... but not in this case...
2006-01-06T15:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Any plan B?
2006-01-06T15:01:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	sudo apt-get remove --purge gdm; sudo apt-get install gdm?
2006-01-06T15:01:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	i think it's too serious...
2006-01-06T15:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Well, do we know what it can hurt?
2006-01-06T15:02:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	if it only removes gdm and the installs it again it just will broke your configuration for gdm
2006-01-06T15:02:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	if it has to remove something more... it's a lot more complicated and dangerous...
2006-01-06T15:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Which includes what, my theme and options like "allow remote login" and stuff?
2006-01-06T15:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	yuma	Would it tell me if it's going to do anything else?  (With a switch?)
2006-01-06T15:05:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	usually it ask you when apt-get performs something more than what you told it to do
2006-01-06T15:06:00.000Z	yuma	tonyyarusso	but can also use the synaptic gui interface to apt-get, so you'll see what's going to happen
