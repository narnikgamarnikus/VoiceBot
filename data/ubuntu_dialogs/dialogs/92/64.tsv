2008-01-18T11:22:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Yes
2008-01-18T11:23:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Yes
2008-01-18T11:23:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Yep
2008-01-18T11:24:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	let me confirm
2008-01-18T11:28:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	I am
2008-01-18T11:29:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	how do i stop this?
2008-01-18T11:29:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	control-c
2008-01-18T11:29:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Getting replies
2008-01-18T11:30:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	hmm. ok now try typing this: host google.com
2008-01-18T11:31:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	warning message parser reports malformed message packet
2008-01-18T11:31:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	timed out
2008-01-18T11:31:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	one sec
2008-01-18T11:31:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Ok
2008-01-18T11:31:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	type: cat /etc/resolv.conf and paste the contents to pastebin.ca for me
2008-01-18T11:34:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	not on the pc with linux but it just says do not edit, then nameserver 192.168.1.1
2008-01-18T11:35:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	what kind of router is it? seems like its sending bad dns replies to you
2008-01-18T11:35:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Good question
2008-01-18T11:36:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	you could override resolv.conf with some dns servers that are known to work. (and tell dhcpclient NOT to overwrite it next lease!)
2008-01-18T11:37:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Ok, sounds good
2008-01-18T11:37:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	http://linux.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/comp.os.linux.networking/2005-09/0088.html seems to be the same issue as you.
2008-01-18T11:40:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	So just use this as a guide then?
2008-01-18T11:40:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	its just an interesting thing i found in google. not sure the cause.
2008-01-18T11:40:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Ok
2008-01-18T11:42:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	how do i override resolv.conf?
2008-01-18T11:42:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	look in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-01-18T11:43:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	 you need to tell dhcpd not to overwrite your changes. then just edit the file with your fav text editor under sudo, and change 192.168.1.1 to another nameserver that works. 128.193.4.20 is oregonstate's nameserver for example.
2008-01-18T11:44:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	alternately, you can use the gui.. under the network settings dialog, theres a DNS tab. delet ethe 192.168.1.1 and add osu's there.
2008-01-18T11:47:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	how do i tell it not to override?
2008-01-18T11:49:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	i dont remember the exact syntax, but in the man page for dhclient.conf it has them. you want to 'supersede' domain-name and domain-name-servers
2008-01-18T11:50:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	it says supersede domain-name fugue.com home.vix.com
2008-01-18T11:51:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	No
2008-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	OH. yeah the # in front means 'comment'
2008-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	I just reinstalled 7.10 tonight
2008-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	thats just an example
2008-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Ok
2008-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	so just like that only take out the # in front and change it.. :)
2008-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	The whole file is an example...
2008-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	says its a sample config file
2008-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	yeah. uncomment the 2 lines and change the host to yours and the 127.0.0.1 to the dns server you want to use
2008-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	says i dont have the permission to save the file
2008-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	you need to use sudo to edit it. its a root owned file
2008-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	in a terminal, run sudo gedit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	And change hostname to what?
2008-01-18T11:59:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	anything you want really.
2008-01-18T11:59:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Oh really now? :D
2008-01-18T12:00:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	its just for advanced cases
2008-01-18T12:00:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	yeah.. or even unplug and replug should do it.
2008-01-18T12:01:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	I'm going to connect wirelessly
2008-01-18T12:01:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	give it a try ;)
2008-01-18T12:04:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	No Go
2008-01-18T12:04:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	cat the resolv.conf again and make sure your changes stayed
2008-01-18T12:06:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	so it overwrote it again.
2008-01-18T12:06:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	go ahead and reboot to make sure dhcpclient is reading your changed config file. then edit the resolv.conf again and then try it...
2008-01-18T12:07:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Hold on a sec
2008-01-18T12:11:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	now its not even timing out
2008-01-18T12:17:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	it keeps changing the second nameserver to the old one
2008-01-18T12:18:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	but its still timing out
2008-01-18T12:20:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	supersede line is still a comment with the fugue.com etcetera
2008-01-18T12:21:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	your talking about /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf ?
2008-01-18T12:21:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	yes
2008-01-18T12:21:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	could you just throw both files on pastebin.ca so i can check what you did?
2008-01-18T12:22:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	both files? isnt it only one?
2008-01-18T12:22:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	dhcpclient overwrites resolv.conf. so 1st your telling it to do so differently, and then your checking that its done it right. resolv.conf is what the system uses to do DNS resolution (turn names into ip addresses)
2008-01-18T12:23:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	so you need to make the proper lines in dhclient.conf first.. then look at resolv.conf to see that its correct.
2008-01-18T12:28:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	I can get you one... the dhclient.conf. resolv.conf is disappearing when i put it on the flash drive (not using the pc with the problem so...)
2008-01-18T12:29:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	http://pastebin.ca/859573
2008-01-18T12:30:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	let ya see the foolishness i did...
2008-01-18T12:30:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	that looks correct
2008-01-18T12:30:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	now what does resolv.conf say exactly?
2008-01-18T12:32:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	hrm. i wonder whats going on then
2008-01-18T12:32:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	try this: host google.com 208.67.222.222
2008-01-18T12:33:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	timed out
2008-01-18T12:33:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	ahh. so the router is also BLOCKING dns requests, in additon to serving bad ones.
2008-01-18T12:33:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	can you get a better one? or figure out somehow whats wrong with it? what kind is it?
2008-01-18T12:34:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	shouldnt be deffective as im using it to come here
2008-01-18T12:34:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	could be it works but is doing something odd linux doesnt like
2008-01-18T12:35:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	paste the error it gives you again about bad request? i lost it
2008-01-18T12:35:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	Warning: Message parser reports malformed message packet
2008-01-18T12:36:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	try this: dig google.com @192.168.1.1

2008-01-18T12:39:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	here is what i get http://pastebin.ca/859585
2008-01-18T12:40:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	nah
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	this could be an ipv6 related bug. hmm
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	I'm going to shut off the router
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	nano__	Rubin	be back
2008-01-18T12:43:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	k
2008-01-18T12:50:00.000Z	Rubin	nano__	googling for this is coming up with a lot of results but no answers. it could be a bug in pdnsd maybe used on the router?  Since its blocking regular requests, its kinda got you in a hard spot :/
