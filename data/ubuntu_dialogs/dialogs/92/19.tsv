2010-06-22T20:46:00.000Z	amanita		i've tried to install from the binary package too.
2010-06-22T20:47:00.000Z	amanita		But nothing solve this problem.
2010-06-22T20:47:00.000Z	amanita		<kesroesweyth> mee too =/
2010-06-22T20:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 depends on the codec the wmv is using. Theres some codecs that are not avilable in linux/ubuntu/for mplayer
2010-06-22T20:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 i can play most wmv's fine in vlc,. and smplayer (mplayer)
2010-06-22T20:49:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i've tried with other players. VLC isn working here.
2010-06-22T20:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 run player from command line, look at output.. see what it says about the video.
2010-06-22T20:51:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i already did. The VLC is with a strange error.
2010-06-22T20:51:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	the default player of ubuntu says that is a codec problem
2010-06-22T20:51:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	and the Mplayer says that cant recognize the video output, and plays only audio.
2010-06-22T20:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 where did this wmv come from?
2010-06-22T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 its not from some PORN or educatial/traning type video site is it?
2010-06-22T20:52:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	dows it matter? Its a video about linux professioal institute.
2010-06-22T20:52:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i've play'd at windows just fine.
2010-06-22T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 Yes it can matter.. some times wmv videos have 'special' copy protection codecs.
2010-06-22T20:53:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	the video was made at linux.
2010-06-22T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 ive seen several cases where students cant get some wmv's from some college/eduation sites working due to DRM. and you dont even want to know about the Malware-DRM-Codecs ive seen peopel at work install to watch..err.. adult stuff.
2010-06-22T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 'at linux' ? it would seem odd its in .wmv then
2010-06-22T20:54:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	couse is a educational video, for the windows users to learn linux and study for the LPI
2010-06-22T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 figure out what codec its using and go from there. Right click on it, properties and see what the tabs say for starters.
2010-06-22T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 how big is the video? is it copyrighted? post it somewhere for otehrs to try it.
2010-06-22T20:55:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	The video gives me the option of play with VLC, Mplayer and the default player of ubuntu.
2010-06-22T20:55:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i've already play'd the video at windows, i know that works. =/
2010-06-22T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 right click -> properties -> look at the tabs..
2010-06-22T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 that points to some odd video codec issue then and not a currupted file
2010-06-22T20:57:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	Type: Windows media video  (video/x-ms-wmv)
2010-06-22T20:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 other then examing the actual file with perhaps ffprobe, ffmpeg  or mencoder and try to convert it/see what it says it is.. i cant offer much more help
2010-06-22T20:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 unless you can give a url to the file for others to check it out.
2010-06-22T21:01:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	ill post to u, wait a bit...
2010-06-22T21:04:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	http://www.fileserve.com/file/SWhdpgg
2010-06-22T21:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 taking 12 min+ to download...
2010-06-22T21:10:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	ill be waiting... It would be very nice if i could play this at linux... Makes no sense see a video about linux at windows.
2010-06-22T21:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 it makes no sence for them to be using .wmv and rar's either...
2010-06-22T21:12:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i agree... But its good stuff... What can i do? =/
2010-06-22T21:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 the only wmv's ive ever had issues playing are either malware-virus laden, or drm'd
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	im almost converting this shit...
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 ive made up scripts to let me right click -> convert to ogg, or whatever else i need.
2010-06-22T21:13:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	its a good idea
2010-06-22T21:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 i spent many a day a few weeks back learning ffmpeg and mencoder basics. to learn how to conver tvideo to  my Cellphone and portable mp4 player  and the wifes portable player.
2010-06-22T21:16:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	must be a little it tricky, but u have a good result.
2010-06-22T21:16:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i'll code something for convert with right click too... Good idea.
2010-06-22T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 nautilus scripts are handy. theres one on gnomelook (i think) called (let me check)
2010-06-22T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 called 'avconvert' - but it dosent work for me.
2010-06-22T21:18:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	Hm... I'll search for something like that.
2010-06-22T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 the videos in that rar are.. .avi and one had a CRC failure. :)
2010-06-22T21:20:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	lol... Its in wmv here. Crazy shit
2010-06-22T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 they are .avi and file 13 and 14 played fine.
2010-06-22T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 -rw-r--r-- 1 willis willis  48869376 2010-03-01 21:26 13_The Linux Kernel.avi
2010-06-22T21:21:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	man, im going crazy. Anyway, i'll convert them all... When i have de patience i'll reinstall ubuntu and run vlc... Thanks.
2010-06-22T21:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 they plaued right off for me in vlc. i am using the vlc 1.1 I think :)
2010-06-22T21:22:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	my vlc dont start.
2010-06-22T21:22:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	look what i got http://pastebin.com/jmUCZktq
2010-06-22T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 1 am using the normal vlc. 1.0.6  the video codec is  'tscc' ive Never heard of that one befor
2010-06-22T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 that looks more like soem vlc issue.. not a codec issue.. but im using 10.04 here. new install.. vlc 1.0.6  + ubuntu restricted extas/w32codecs and the 2 avi in that rar both play
2010-06-22T21:25:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	im pretty sure that is a vlc issue. And thats what i really want to solve, couse i think vlc would play my .wmv files just fine
2010-06-22T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 totem does not play them properly
2010-06-22T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 make a new user.. see if it works for them
2010-06-22T21:26:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	no
2010-06-22T21:26:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	already did. =/
2010-06-22T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 vlc works here, totem - has flashing bars.. lets try.. mplayer
2010-06-22T21:27:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	mlpayer gives me this error:  error opening/iniatilizing  the selected video_out (-vo) device
2010-06-22T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 you ahve to set the defauilt video out first.. it stupidly defaults to  some weird thing.. instead of xv
2010-06-22T21:28:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	let me see!
2010-06-22T21:28:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i have to set this at mplayer?
2010-06-22T21:30:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	dude, awesome!
2010-06-22T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 mplayer dont like it either.. thast must be some weird codec.. it does some sound, then starts skipping
2010-06-22T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 did it finally work?
2010-06-22T21:30:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i've just seted to Xv at mplayer
2010-06-22T21:31:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	yup! Great! A tiny problem, and so annoying...
2010-06-22T21:31:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	thanks a lot!
2010-06-22T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 no idea why vlc dont like it.. weird.
2010-06-22T21:31:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	vlc isnt running here.
2010-06-22T21:32:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	vlc dont start. Isnt a codec problem, its a vlc issue.
2010-06-22T21:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 check google for info on that codec perhaps.
2010-06-22T21:33:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	no, no... The VLC isnt working. The program dont start up.
2010-06-22T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 ffprobe says the video is ---->  Stream #0.0: Video: camtasia, rgb555, 800x600, 15 tbr, 15 tbn, 15 tbc
2010-06-22T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 ive never seen a camtasia codec.. may be some screen shot thing
2010-06-22T21:34:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	no dude, my vlc isnt working, understand?
2010-06-22T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 im still trying to figure out why you said it was a wmv.. when i got a .avi .....
2010-06-22T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 can vlc play ANything else at all?
2010-06-22T21:35:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	maybe couse the link i give to u was a diferent source of mine.
2010-06-22T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 could be they have differnt links/downloads depending on the browser you are browsing the site with also.
2010-06-22T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 you downloaded the thing originally in windows?
2010-06-22T21:36:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	yup, couse i'd to search again. No, i downloaded originally at ubuntu.
2010-06-22T21:37:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i'd to go to windows for make sure that the video was ok.
2010-06-22T21:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 well that rar did have a bad file in it.. so  its hard to tell whats going on. at least now you can watch that Exciteing video about the linux kernel.
2010-06-22T21:38:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	but i dont have problem to run the files, my problem with vlc is other issue... The VLC dont start, isnt running.
2010-06-22T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 even just by itself it dont run eh?  not trying to play a file
2010-06-22T21:39:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	i think i cant make myself clear... The software VLC isnt starting the interface.
2010-06-22T21:39:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	not even by itself.
2010-06-22T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amanita	 that is weird then.. You havent been upgrading any thing from  unofficial sites have you?
2010-06-22T21:39:00.000Z	amanita	Dr_Willis	no, i've downloaded from ubuntu sources... When i start it from the terminal i got this: http://pastebin.com/jmUCZktq
