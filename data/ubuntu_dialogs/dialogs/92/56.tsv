2009-07-28T11:47:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	you're testing the bot ?
2009-07-28T11:47:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	or searching for informations ?
2009-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	i use it but only because it works out of the box for me.
2009-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	hehe ok was just wondering if you were trying to find something and if i could help ya
2009-07-28T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	help away. it's always welcommed
2009-07-28T11:52:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	now i'm woken up cause of those oops
2009-07-28T12:07:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	there is simplier ways
2009-07-28T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	to do what?
2009-07-28T12:07:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	i know a tool for restoring grub that works perfectly on ubcd
2009-07-28T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	its not really restoring, its addig an extra option for windows
2009-07-28T12:08:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	this boot cd is really cool and plenty of tools and always usefull in such situation www.ultimatebootcd.com
2009-07-28T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	used it a billion times dude
2009-07-28T12:08:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	great im not alone :)
2009-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	used to work in a pc repair shop, idiots forgetting their admin pass all the time. classic
2009-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	HAHA exactly same
2009-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	i have my enterprise of repairing computer
2009-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	been and done it, i fix thousands of servers now, remotely from uk to usa
2009-07-28T12:10:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	wow great :)
2009-07-28T12:10:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	it must pay a lot more now no ? :)
2009-07-28T12:17:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	is in secret love with ubottu
2009-11-04T17:43:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	if i have something that i'm quite sad of is the new software installing program wich seems not to be finished and you're totally obliged to use synaptic at the end
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	i dont use either, i always use apt-get
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	and they made like it was a brand new stuff but we already had a kind of add/remove software that i even find better
2009-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	i usinstall software-centre. I never use it so I save space
2009-11-04T17:46:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	may you can help me, would like to manage services in karmic but the simple software that was doing it can't be found
2009-11-06T18:26:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	hi man how can i install xubuntu on a flash disk without touching grub from my actual ubuntu and the .iso of the archive ?
2009-11-06T18:26:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	Cause i only see a .exe when i mount it but no linux executable
2009-11-06T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	http://www.pendrivelinux.com/create-a-xubuntu-9-10-flash-drive-using-windows/
2009-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	that's exactly what i don't need, i told you i'm on linux already and i think we only can do it from windows that's my question
2009-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	not sure, i always use my GFs lappy to do it
2009-11-06T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	but if you can get it on there it can have its own boot loader so will not touch your current grub
2009-11-06T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you can dd the netbook remix img to the usb
2009-11-06T18:30:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	why netbook remix cause its all already extracted ?
2009-11-06T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	its an img file, not an iso
2009-11-06T19:02:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	in fact i have windows seven so i'm gonna mount it with daemontools and install it from windows but i want to be sure that it won't touch my mbr and i don't know how to do that cause i don't see where we can set that during the installation process
2009-11-09T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	hal will hopefully sort the driver out
2009-11-09T02:47:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	could you explain me ?
2009-11-09T02:47:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	my xorg (im on the usb key right now) load fglrx and i would like that on the nvidia computer it load another xorg.conf
2009-11-09T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	karmic relies on hal to detectstuff, hence there being no xorg.conf file at all (very annoying), so if either hardware is found it will load the most suitable driver
2009-11-09T02:49:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	you mean that if on my actuall ati.run configured xubuntu on my usb key i install nvidia drivers hal will automaticly load the nvidia driver ? and how about conflict of dkms modules ? and how about settings in xorg ?
2009-11-09T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	i guess, ive not tried it but it "should" detect it an load the right driver, if you have an xorg.conf file this will override hal
2009-11-09T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you could add some lines to grub2 conf which MAY be able to modify the xorg.conf file, it may be possiblr but ive not done it
2009-11-09T02:56:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	you know i don't care even about that it detects it i would not mind to tell him i want to load xubuntu as nvidia computer or as ati ones i would like to have grub entries that could load just different xorg.conf i don't know how to do that to specify the grub loaded on that entry
2009-11-09T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	that may be possble in the new grub, it does allow scripting but I'm unsure if it can modify the partitions or not, You may want to look at mandiva one, that is a mobile usb based distro, it may support multiple video card manufactures being connected when it boots as you wish
2009-11-09T03:01:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	last question and thank you for you answers, would it be possible to install xubuntu on a usb disk and then add an application like a pack that make your ubuntu able to install ubuntu brand new on other computers
2009-11-09T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	sure you can use aptoncd
2009-11-09T03:03:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	so i can make an install ubuntu being a live cd as a software ?
2009-11-09T03:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you may be able to add the usb as a repo
2009-11-09T03:04:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	ok
2009-12-01T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	xorg.conf once set wioll save settings
2009-12-12T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	is the mac running MacOS?
2009-12-12T20:26:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	yes hehe otherwise would be ultra easy :)
2009-12-12T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	macOS isnt supported here
2009-12-12T20:28:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	ok so basicly you know how to do but as we are on a ubuntu help channel you don't wanna tell me that's it ? please i'm helping everybody on ubuntu kubuntu and ubuntu-fr all the time i just need a simple answer would be cool to have someone answering me, it's at least for a ubuntu disk so it has a rapport with it
2009-12-12T20:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	its offtopic here, you are running MacOS to access a partition, so you want #mac or some apple mac channel and they will tell you how mac os can access ext3
2009-12-17T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	32bit can only see a little over 3Gb ram
2009-12-17T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you can install 64bit as Alex_21says, or install a PAE enabled kernel
2009-12-17T05:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you can install the server kernel which has PAE enabled by default
2009-12-17T06:07:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	then i surely know that 64 bits handles it but i don't care about 64
2009-12-17T06:08:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	and then for the kernel server i don't want a server on my computer
2009-12-17T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	true but PAE will give a 32bit system access to more ram
2009-12-17T06:08:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	and last thing, i would be ashame to know i've managed by tricks to make my Windows Seven handle and USE all my 4 gb memory on the 32 bits version and that i didn't managed on the Linux
2009-12-17T06:09:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	it's not possible that Windows begins to have possibilities that doesn't exist in Linux or the world gonna go crazy no ? :)
2009-12-17T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	its not a "server" you are just using the kernel from the server install which has PAE enable by default, you can recompile the desktop kernel to have PAE enbled if you are feeling adventurous, you will get the same thing using the server kernel
2009-12-17T06:09:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	tell me about PAE
2009-12-17T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	websearch it, its WAY too complex to discuss here. a 32Bit OS can only access 3.2Gb of RAM due to 32bit address registers. a 32bit Windows XP will access the same amount of RAM
2009-12-17T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	so its not something windows can do which linux can't. Linux was one of the first true 64bit OSes
2009-12-17T06:11:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	ok understood ! Things is first it's not a big big problem and then i don't want to reinstall at all, and neither to recompile my kernel. Aint there some new kernels that have PAE enabled by default that are not server kernels ?
2009-12-17T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	well, on desktop
2009-12-17T06:11:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	i know why it can't but i've managed to do it on Windows Seven 32 bits and you can be sure it's using the entire 4 gigs for real
2009-12-17T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you dont have to reinstall, you can simply install the server kernel, reboot and boot to the server kernel and youwill see all your ram
2009-12-17T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	it can't its not possible, 2^32 is less than 4Gb
2009-12-17T06:13:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	i assure you it's not a patch to make it stop bugging but a patch to make windows use it instead of using a pagefil.sys
2009-12-17T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	http://chris.pirillo.com/32-bit-windows-and-4gb-of-ram/
2009-12-17T06:13:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	i just ca assure you it does
2009-12-17T06:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	you need the server kernel or 64bit OS, that or not use all yuor RAM. Your call
2009-12-17T06:14:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	i've tested to launch many apps to pass the bar of 3.5 gigs of memory and in the monitoring system it was shown that it was only using physicall memory and nothing about the paging
2009-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	trust me, i can't tell you how it works but it does even if i know also that it shouldn't be possible at al
2009-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	your address registers cannot read or write past 3.12Gb RAM
2009-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	then you have managed to address past the address registers in your CPU somehow, i doubt it
2009-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	then what to say, my computer is magic and my system monitor is lying to me
2009-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	it must be
2009-12-17T06:16:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	if we think that after using 3 gb of memory the windows will go and take in the pagefil.sys we can easily imagine that he ghost a part of the pagefile in the real resting physical memory
2009-12-17T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	your system is magical and defies common computing and maths
2009-12-17T06:18:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	ActionParsnip	would love so but i m not sure as i've read thread to do that and saw many replies saying it works mervelously and there's was people doubting about it on the beginning that were saying that it was truly working
2011-10-31T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	sure you can, just not as easily
2011-10-31T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jacquesdupontd	if you use dconf-tools you can set org.gnome.desktop.interface.gtk-theme, org.gnome.desktop.interface.icon-theme and org.gnome.desktop.interface.cursor-theme
