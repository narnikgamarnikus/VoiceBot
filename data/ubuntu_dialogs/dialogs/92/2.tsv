2012-08-31T04:32:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	other than "ls" no idea what to do
2012-08-31T04:35:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Did you just install it or upgrade to the latest?
2012-08-31T04:35:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	just intalled it
2012-08-31T04:36:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	installed GRUB before?
2012-08-31T04:36:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	but used the partition manager to format and pick out a partition
2012-08-31T04:36:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	never, as in, no idea how to configure it
2012-08-31T04:37:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	man and help don't work so i'm pretty clueless
2012-08-31T04:38:00.000Z	worm		Do you still remember the partition's name where you had got your ubuntu in? like sda2 or sdb3 etc.
2012-08-31T04:38:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	sure i can ls
2012-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	it was sdb2,,
2012-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	worm		Then try "root (hd1,1)"
2012-08-31T04:40:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	unknown command root
2012-08-31T04:44:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Seems you are using Grub2 now. try "set root=(hd1,1)
2012-08-31T04:45:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	done now what?
2012-08-31T04:45:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	linux /boot/vmlinuz<Press Tab>
2012-08-31T04:46:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	tab doesn't autocomplete to anyhting
2012-08-31T04:46:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	and linux is unknown command to :(
2012-08-31T04:50:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Linux is also unknown command? Did you complete the installation?
2012-08-31T04:50:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	yes, it asked me to restart
2012-08-31T04:50:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	it even updated grub from the web
2012-08-31T04:55:00.000Z	Launch_Director		!grub
2012-08-31T04:55:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	That is strange. Try this: kernel /boot/grub/core.img
2012-08-31T04:55:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	....unknown command kernel
2012-08-31T04:56:00.000Z	Launch_Director		crazy stuff
2012-08-31T04:56:00.000Z	worm		Try insmod normal
2012-08-31T04:56:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	error: unknown filesystem
2012-08-31T04:58:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Are your filesystem working well?
2012-08-31T04:58:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	i used ext3
2012-08-31T04:58:00.000Z	Launch_Director		so i guess so
2012-08-31T04:58:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	then "set prefix=(hd0,8)/boot/grub"
2012-08-31T04:58:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	the rest are NTSF from my windows partition
2012-08-31T04:59:00.000Z	worm		As if you can list all of the files in Grub rescue, your filesystem should be OK.
2012-08-31T05:00:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	after set prefix, try insmod normal again
2012-08-31T05:00:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	error,no such partition
2012-08-31T05:01:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Sorry, it is "set prefix=(hd1,1)/boot/grub"
2012-08-31T05:01:00.000Z	worm		I forgot to change it to yours...
2012-08-31T05:02:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	now it says unknown filesystem
2012-08-31T05:02:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	it's possible i might have been wrong about the sdXX
2012-08-31T05:03:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	altough i do remember seing sdb1 or 2
2012-08-31T05:03:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	how about ls's result?
2012-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	worm		If you can see boot home lib root tmp usr var etc. you are now in correct partition.
2012-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	ls shows me only (hdX,msdosX)
2012-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	Launch_Director		where X is a number from 1 to 5
2012-08-31T05:06:00.000Z	worm		You may try to use your installation CD and choose "Try without change" or something like that to start up your computer, then you can find out which one is your Ubuntu root.
2012-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	and i should get something like (hdX) ?
2012-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	and also want to make sure if you are on "grub rescue>_" or "rescue grub>_"
2012-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	i'm on grub rescue>
2012-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Just count. sda=hd0 sdb=hd1 etc. so sda1=hd0,0 sda2=hd0,1
2012-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	cool thanks, ill do some trial and error
2012-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	when you can see "rescue grub", try normal to get back to normal grub
2012-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Sorry for my fault. it should be like this: (hd0) = sda; (hd0,1)=sda1; (hd1,3)=sdb3
2012-08-31T05:11:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	looks like it got insmod normal for hd1,2
2012-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	what do i type in now
2012-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	That's my fault... I got used to grub1 ... and grub 2 made some small change.
2012-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	Launch_Director		btw nothing happened after i did insmod normal
2012-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	try normal
2012-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	Launch_Director		showed up
2012-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	Launch_Director		:D
2012-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	worm		The original grub?
2012-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	the normal :)
2012-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	Launch_Director		but it can't find the partition
2012-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	when i select ubuntum it says no such partition
2012-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Then press e to edit the ubuntu's location
2012-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	yep i see now,
2012-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	Launch_Director		inmod gzio
2012-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	As if you can understand what we've done in "grub rescue", you should be able to understand the lines.
2012-08-31T05:16:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	ye, there are several lines, one says "insmod ext2" ,should it change this to ext3?
2012-08-31T05:16:00.000Z	worm		Sure
2012-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Change everything to make it suits your computer.
2012-08-31T05:18:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	i should prob put in the ubuntu install disk to check for sure what partition
2012-08-31T05:20:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	atm it won't even boot into windows :(,, lots of stuff to fix
2012-08-31T05:20:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	i'll try with hirene
2012-08-31T05:20:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	if you don't want to do that, you can do this: press Esc to back to the OS menu, then try these commands: (hold on a second. I am going to pastebin it.)
2012-08-31T05:21:00.000Z	worm		Press c to enter command line, and then...
2012-08-31T05:22:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1176986/
2012-08-31T05:23:00.000Z	worm		If it works correctly, you should be able to re-build your grub configure automatically.
2012-08-31T05:23:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	cool, but i need to know the values of x, and y, atm they all show up as (X,msdosY)
2012-08-31T05:24:00.000Z	Launch_Director		or i just write the commands exactly?
2012-08-31T05:24:00.000Z	worm		That (hdx,y)is where your ubuntu there.
2012-08-31T05:24:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	 it should be (hd1,2)
2012-08-31T05:25:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	as I tried to make it suits every condition
2012-08-31T05:26:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	Wish your problem can be all solved... I even have not got a computer with grub2 now...
2012-08-31T05:28:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	yeh i'll check in hirene or something, i can't find the partition, i keep getting "No such partition" when i try to run "linux /vmlinuz"
2012-08-31T05:29:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	have you seen anything when you typed "(hd1,2)"
2012-08-31T05:30:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	atm nothing other than above
2012-08-31T05:31:00.000Z	worm		You may try hd1,1 again...I am getting confused...
2012-08-31T05:31:00.000Z	Launch_Director	worm	i'll try with hirene if that doesn't work ill try with ubuntu cd, and report back :)
2012-08-31T05:33:00.000Z	worm	Launch_Director	sorry for that. you might need to ask others for help at that time. I am going to have a English lesson now, as I am still a student.
