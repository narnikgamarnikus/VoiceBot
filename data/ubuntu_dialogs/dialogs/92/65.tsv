2007-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	intangir		you dont run swat from the command line
2007-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	intangir		and i believe swat is run from inetd
2007-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	intangir		so you dont start it
2007-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	intangir		you just goto port 901 or something like that
2007-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	intangir		localhost:901
2007-06-26T16:42:00.000Z	intangir		do you have inetd loaded?
2007-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	intangir		check /etc/inetd.conf
2007-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	intangir		make sure there is a line in there for swat, and that its not #commented out
2007-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	intangir		it SHOULD be in there if you installed swat
2007-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	intangir	:swat  stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/swat
2007-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		i head this string there
2007-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		had
2007-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		no it is not!
2007-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	well hrm it should work then, type this: cat /etc/services | grep swat
2007-06-26T16:45:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, swat            901/tcp                         # swat
2007-06-26T16:45:00.000Z	intangir		well thats weird, looks like everything is there
2007-06-26T16:46:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	try this: sudo /etc/init.d/inetd restart
2007-06-26T16:46:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		firefox cannot establish connection with localhost:901
2007-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, sudo: /etc/init.d/inetd: command not found
2007-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	aha!
2007-06-26T16:48:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	intangir	so what i should do?
2007-06-26T16:48:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	check my private messages
2007-06-26T16:49:00.000Z	intangir		bah, i didnt log in so you cant see my queries
2007-06-26T16:50:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	first make a backup copy of your inetd.conf
2007-06-26T16:50:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		i don't see an private messages
2007-06-26T16:50:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	apparently swat didnt depend on inetd, even though it needs it, so it didnt add to the config, since it didnt exist yet
2007-06-26T16:50:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	type this: sudo cp /etc/inetd.conf inetd.conf.b4
2007-06-26T16:50:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, how i should create it
2007-06-26T16:51:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		ok
2007-06-26T16:51:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	sudo apt-get install openbsd-inetd
2007-06-26T16:51:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir it is ok now
2007-06-26T16:52:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, what i should do next?
2007-06-26T16:53:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	you installed openbsd-inetd?
2007-06-26T16:53:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		yes
2007-06-26T16:53:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, yes
2007-06-26T16:53:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	did you copy the swat line back into inetd.conf?
2007-06-26T16:53:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	sudo cat /etc/inetd.conf.b4 >> /etc/inetd.conf
2007-06-26T16:54:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, bash: /etc/inetd.conf: Permission denied
2007-06-26T16:54:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	sudo cat /etc/inetd.conf.b4 >> /etc/inetd.conf
2007-06-26T16:54:00.000Z	intangir		it gave you that error?
2007-06-26T16:55:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	did it work?
2007-06-26T16:55:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, i typed what you said and get this
2007-06-26T16:55:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		bash: /etc/inetd.conf: Permission denied
2007-06-26T16:55:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	ok try it like this instaed ;)
2007-06-26T16:55:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	sudo su
2007-06-26T16:56:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	cat /etc/inetd.conf.b4 >> /etc/inetd.conf
2007-06-26T16:56:00.000Z	intangir		lol
2007-06-26T16:56:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	then after that: /etc/init.d/inetd restart
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, cat: /etc/inetd.conf.b4: No such file or directory
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	intangir		bah, didnt you make the copy before you installed ?
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	copy this line to the bottom of your inetd.conf file :swatIIstreamItcpInowait.400IrootI/usr/sbin/tcpdI/usr/sbin/swat
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	intangir		im not sure if you need the first : or not
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	intangir		thats from what you pasted me
2007-06-26T16:59:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, with semicoma?
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, and where i can find inetd.conf file
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	1 sec
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		Oh
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		now it works
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		swat asking me username and password
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	intangir		oh sweet
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	intangir		grats
2007-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		Intagir, Thank you very much
2007-06-26T05:01:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	your welcome
2007-06-26T05:01:00.000Z	intangir		it woulda worked without issue if swat had correctly depended on inetd
2007-06-26T05:01:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, maybe you can help me one more time?
2007-06-26T05:01:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		i set up swat because i can't see any pc in my workgroup except me
2007-06-26T05:01:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	are you using ubuntu? nautilus can actually browse networks pretty well
2007-06-26T05:02:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, yes i am using ubuntu, i think it should be easy to see pcs with winxp os
2007-06-26T05:03:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, but in my workgroup i can see only my pc, but if i'll type an ip op winxp pc i can access it
2007-06-26T05:03:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	maybe your not looking in the right workgroup
2007-06-26T05:03:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		bo
2007-06-26T05:04:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, no! i am in that group here is command line in smb.conf workgroup = HOME
2007-06-26T05:04:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, it is 100% correct workgroup
2007-06-26T05:05:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	i dont know then, windows is lame ;) blame windows
2007-06-26T05:05:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, i know that windows is lame, but i need to access pc
2007-06-26T05:06:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	all i can suggest is to goto nautilus: then on the menu select Go->Network
2007-06-26T05:06:00.000Z	intangir		and browse them out, open windows network
2007-06-26T05:06:00.000Z	intangir		select the right workgroup
2007-06-26T05:06:00.000Z	intangir		and it should open them up
2007-06-26T05:06:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, it is very pity to me
2007-06-26T05:06:00.000Z	intangir		it works for me, im in a large office and i can access 30 somethign guys from here
2007-06-26T05:07:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	maybe there is something fishy about the network setup
2007-06-26T05:07:00.000Z	intangir		or maybe its not allowing certain broadcasts
2007-06-26T05:07:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	you can try typing in the compute rnames like "smb://someonesbox"
2007-06-26T05:07:00.000Z	intangir		in nautilus
2007-06-26T05:08:00.000Z	intangir		nautilus i think can view/mount most windows shares even without samba installed
2007-06-26T05:08:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		no
2007-06-26T05:08:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir, no
2007-06-26T05:08:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir but smb://someonIP - yes
2007-06-26T05:09:00.000Z	ParanoyaM		intagir
2007-06-26T05:09:00.000Z	intangir	ParanoyaM	well at least that works, not sure how else to help you on that, mine works already
