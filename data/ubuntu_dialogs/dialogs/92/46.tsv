2009-03-25T00:20:00.000Z	crispy--		After a kernel update in 8.10 from 2.6.27.9 to 2.6.27.11 my wireless broke. I use a broadcom wireless with the b43 module. Worked perfectly before update, but now I cant connect with DHCP and must manually set IP, and the connection is incredibly unstable (actually useless, but there) Any help?
2009-03-25T00:20:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	you have to use the proprietary drivers for that card
2009-03-25T00:21:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	yea that isnt working?
2009-03-25T00:32:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	let me try and locate it
2009-03-25T00:21:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	is it activated
2009-03-25T00:22:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	um yea...i had that same problem actually
2009-03-25T00:22:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	but yea its a bug
2009-03-25T00:22:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	got instructions on how to fix it?
2009-03-25T00:22:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	i had to reactivate the b43fwcutter thing
2009-03-25T00:23:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	can you bring it up
2009-03-25T00:24:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	for your ap?
2009-03-25T00:25:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	the ap is your's
2009-03-25T00:26:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	possible environmental interference?
2009-03-25T00:27:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	yea...how fast did u get with this card before because they do kind of suck
2009-03-25T00:28:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	make sure the card is in managed mode
2009-03-25T00:28:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	and change the tx power of it to the highest
2009-03-25T00:30:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	is it possible you have more than one interface for that card
2009-03-25T00:31:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	did you try the broadcom STA drivers
2009-03-25T00:36:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	you dont have a hardware drivers utility in system, administration?
2009-03-25T00:36:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	ok hold on
2009-03-25T00:40:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	u there
2009-03-25T00:40:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	http://www.broadcom.com/support/802.11/linux_sta.php
2009-03-25T00:40:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	thats straight from broadcom, i cant find the repo that has the .deb package
2009-03-25T00:41:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	did u get that?
2009-03-25T00:42:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	its supposed to be faster
2009-03-25T00:56:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	i unloaded b43 and ssb, and loaded the built module with the ieee crypt module - but now the device is not working
2009-03-25T00:57:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	ok lemme look at this
2009-03-25T01:00:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	install ndiswrapper
2009-03-25T01:02:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	hmm what package should I choose?
2009-03-25T01:02:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	you said somehthing about wl.ko?
2009-03-25T01:04:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	copy that to /lib/modules/KERNEL.../misc/
2009-03-25T01:06:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	copied now, should i make it executable, i see the other modules there have different permissions
2009-03-25T01:07:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	just to be safe i guess
2009-03-25T01:07:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	okay you compiled that right
2009-03-25T01:08:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	w/o errors i mean
2009-03-25T01:09:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	okay now there might be a module grabbing the interface first
2009-03-25T01:09:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	we need to blacklist it,  it's called ssb
2009-03-25T01:10:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	and blacklist the b43 module too
2009-03-25T01:12:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	both are blacklisted now
2009-03-25T01:12:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	okay now sudo update-initramfs -u
2009-03-25T01:14:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	yea and ur interface will be eth1 probably
2009-03-25T01:15:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	i already had a wl module that could be loaded, how do I make sure that its the compiled one i load instead of the build in one?
2009-03-25T01:16:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	you'll have to make sure you have the name right and blacklist the other one if its still around
2009-03-25T01:16:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	compare timestamps?
2009-03-25T01:21:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	seems like the module is still not loaded correctly
2009-03-25T01:21:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	list your interfaces
2009-03-25T01:23:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	just do an iwconfig
2009-03-25T01:26:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	you did an iwconfig right?
2009-03-25T01:26:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	okay edit /etc/network/interfaces to reflect that eth1 is your wireless interface
2009-03-25T01:27:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	couldnt it also be my wired card that is displayed as eth0?
2009-03-25T01:27:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	okay wired is eth0
2009-03-25T01:27:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	eth1 will be wireless
2009-03-25T01:28:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	iwconfig will list all the wireless interfaces
2009-03-25T01:28:00.000Z	crispy--	blip	I have never played with that file before, how do I make it reflect that eth0 is wireless?
2009-03-25T01:29:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	it should be obvious...you probably have an entry for ur old wlan0 interface...just change that
2009-03-25T01:30:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	add this
2009-03-25T01:30:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	auto eth1
2009-03-25T01:31:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	ok restart NetworkManager
2009-03-25T01:32:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	better.. force-reload
2009-03-25T01:32:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	bring it up manually
2009-03-25T01:34:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	flip the switch for the card once...see if that helps
2009-03-25T01:35:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	are u using a laptop?
2009-03-25T01:36:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	ok
2009-03-25T01:36:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	those r usually mini-pci's for laptops
2009-03-25T01:36:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	does it load the module
2009-03-25T01:37:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	do u know what pan0 is?
2009-03-25T01:37:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	get rid of it
2009-03-25T01:37:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	it was in ur /etc/network interfaces right?
2009-03-25T01:38:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	okay then its virtual
2009-03-25T01:38:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	can you bring the card up... ifconfig eth1 up ?
2009-03-25T01:40:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	yea that def is
2009-03-25T01:40:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	i thought u said you had an eth1 when you did iwconfig
2009-03-25T01:41:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	ok ifconfig -a then
2009-03-25T01:41:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	ok ifconfig
2009-03-25T01:42:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	you have eth0, vmnet0, pan0, .....what else
2009-03-25T01:43:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	lspci | grep broad
2009-03-25T01:45:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	jesus this is frustrating
2009-03-25T01:46:00.000Z	blip	crispy--	that's network manager
