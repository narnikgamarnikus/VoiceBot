2008-04-19T04:56:00.000Z	amenado		Orbixx-> would you like to use another tool? perhaps the command line?
2008-04-19T04:57:00.000Z	amenado		Orbixx-> what? you are going to sit there 2/47 and view the monitor for spikes?
2008-04-19T04:58:00.000Z	amenado		Orbixx-> then that should be possible, use -j LOG on your rulez

File should be owned by user and have 644 permissions. User's $HOME directory must be owned by user and not be writable by others.

2008-05-18T07:51:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	:-)
2008-05-20T04:35:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	and then there's people like me, I do a fresh install every week just to fix all the things I've "fixed" that week! ;-) but on a serious note, i could use your help in a bit?
2008-05-20T04:37:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	cool, i have here lately, lol, but those days are gone with the new wireless card :-))))))
2008-05-20T04:39:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	speaking of which, i have only done the alternate install once, and that was with help from someone in almost real-time on the forum (before i knew about this channel)
2008-05-20T04:42:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	i most certainly will, however, i was helping someone who is now downloading the alt ISO to attempt an install because the live cd kept freezing, any chance you can help him?
2008-05-20T04:43:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	he was/is??
2008-05-20T04:44:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	ok
2008-05-20T04:55:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	i see you met the person i was referring to :-)
2008-05-22T05:16:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	any chance you're there?
2008-06-08T09:48:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	i did man touch,,, and now i feel kinda dirty
2008-06-13T08:02:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	can you log into it?
2008-06-13T08:02:00.000Z	amenado	SeaPhor	i can log in to it yes, its not my router its a friend, and am trying to assist him so I can login to his ubuntu behind that firewall
2008-06-13T08:05:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	if you can log into it (i haven't used that particular one) but you should have a security section, some uncomfortable but necessary browsing and see what options are there, sorry i cant help more that that on that router
2008-06-13T08:07:00.000Z	amenado	SeaPhor	i already have done those, thanks... am seeking info on what DMZ really meant on that router, and how to acquire the external ip address of the router to be assigned to an ubuntu box rather than the 192.168.x.x address
2008-06-13T08:07:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	tracert doesn't show that?
2008-06-13T08:08:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	sorry. thought you wanted to know the wan addy for the router
2008-06-18T07:26:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	heya bro!
2008-06-25T04:51:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	ty, i'll look into it
2008-06-25T04:56:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	how would i monitor (real-time) when a user logs on and what directory user is in at the moment? and what port user is logged in thru?
2008-08-19T19:19:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	if i wanted to run a script, a program at start-up, would i add that to the rc.local file?
2008-08-19T19:21:00.000Z	SeaPhor	amenado	thats the only way i could think of, is there a better way?
