2005-09-11T14:42:00.000Z	linner		intel:  are you fully switched over?
2005-09-11T14:42:00.000Z	linner		meaning, are you using a linux box onlly?
2005-09-11T14:43:00.000Z	linner		hehehe
2005-09-11T14:43:00.000Z	linner		is anyone trying to sync a Tungsten T3 with Evolution's palm client?
2005-09-11T14:44:00.000Z	linner		or a Palm anything for that matter
2005-09-11T14:45:00.000Z	linner		thoreau:  nice, thanks :)
2005-09-11T14:46:00.000Z	linner		<-- can take a joke... :)
2005-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	linner		bye Thoreau
2005-09-11T14:47:00.000Z	linner		:)
2005-09-11T14:48:00.000Z	linner		i guess i'm curious why in the world would anyone want to dual boot linux and windows?  the whole point is to move away from windoze I thought.
2005-09-11T14:48:00.000Z	bob2	linner	how is that the "whole point"?  people can use whatever they want for whatever purpose they want
2005-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 yes, I agree... and I'm just wondering why they'd want to dual boot
2005-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	bob2	linner	some people like playing games, or using some obscure app that doens't run in wine
2005-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 got it...
2005-09-11T14:49:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 wasn't trying to offend; trying to understand....
2005-09-12T13:25:00.000Z	bob2	linner	enable multivers
2005-09-12T13:25:00.000Z	bob2	linner	/msg dpkg repositories
2005-09-12T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	linner	are you using i386 ubuntu?
2005-09-12T13:27:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 I'm using ubuntu 5.04 breezy
2005-09-12T13:27:00.000Z	bob2	linner	that's nice.  what architecture?
2005-09-12T13:28:00.000Z	bob2	linner	you don't know what sort of CPU your machine has?
2005-09-12T13:28:00.000Z	bob2	linner	an athlon what?
2005-09-12T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	linner	a set of Ubuntu packages
2005-09-12T13:30:00.000Z	bob2	linner	to see *what*?
2005-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	bob2	linner	why are you downloading tarballs of anythings?
2005-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	bob2	linner	so, you're going the wrong way here
2005-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	bob2	linner	you need to get the package for flash, not some random .tar.gz file
2005-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	bob2	linner	open /etc/apt/sources.list in a text editor. paste it to #flood.
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	linner	generally it's a lot simpler: tick the box in synaptic, click install, all done.
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	linner	no need to even go find it
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	linner	bob2	and thoreauputic:  i know it's just figuring it out... how!
2005-09-19T06:36:00.000Z	bob2	linner	just use window's normal filesharring stuff then
2005-09-19T06:36:00.000Z	linner	bob2	tried that... its asking me to connect to the computer... with passwords
2005-09-19T06:36:00.000Z	bob2	linner	then tell windows to share things anonymously
2005-09-19T06:37:00.000Z	linner	bob2	I'm confused.  How do I do that?
2005-09-19T06:37:00.000Z	bob2	linner	right clik on something in windows. share tab. ???. profit.
2005-09-19T06:37:00.000Z	linner	bob2	ok... let me go try
2005-09-19T06:38:00.000Z	linner	bob2	do you recommend samba for what I'm looking for?
2005-09-19T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	linner	samba only lets your linux machine serve files, it doesn't help linux access windows shares
2005-09-19T06:39:00.000Z	linner	bob2	oh okay
2005-09-19T06:39:00.000Z	linner	bob2	what do you think about filezilla?
2005-09-19T06:41:00.000Z	bob2	linner	I have no idea what that is
2005-09-19T06:44:00.000Z	bob2	linner	no
2005-09-19T06:45:00.000Z	linner	bob2	you say no to Samba and smbfs?
2005-09-19T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	linner	I didn't say that
2005-09-19T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	linner	if you want to use windows shares from linux, smbfs is a good option
2005-09-19T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	linner	then share things anonymously
2005-09-19T06:47:00.000Z	linner	bob2	I can't find the share anonymously think you're suggesting
2005-09-19T06:47:00.000Z	linner	bob2	so I'll do a google search and figure it out
2005-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	linner	ripgut do NOT paste stuff in here, it floods the channel and annoys everyone
2005-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 I'm sorry... I thought I sent it to pluggo in a PM .. that's why i asked him if I could PM him
2005-09-29T15:32:00.000Z	bob2	linner	it's some creepy "emoticon"
2005-09-29T15:45:00.000Z	linner	bob2	you're always in here at night my time... where are you from?
2005-09-29T15:46:00.000Z	bob2	linner	australia
2005-09-29T15:46:00.000Z	linner	bob2	ahhhh... makes more sense
2005-09-29T13:21:00.000Z	bob2	linner	I really doubt that is the issue
2005-09-29T13:21:00.000Z	bob2	linner	does your X log really not show what's happening?
2005-09-29T13:21:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 what do you think is the issue?
2005-09-29T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	linner	less /var/log/X.whatever
2005-09-29T13:23:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 i don't know what "whatever" means
2005-09-29T13:23:00.000Z	bob2	linner	it means "use ls /var/log to find out what it's called, or use your shell's tab completion"
2005-09-29T13:24:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 I do not know linux what so ever.. so i have to get exact commands unfortunately
2005-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	linner	bob2	i'm in recovery mode and need to know how to change my ATI card driver.
2005-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	linner	that makes no sense
2005-09-30T09:29:00.000Z	linner	bob2	I am in recovery mode.  X Server is not loading.  I need to change the driver it is using when it boots.
2005-09-30T09:30:00.000Z	linner	bob2	there are commands that we've used in the past and I do not know what they are.
2005-09-30T09:30:00.000Z	bob2	linner	why do you think you need to change the driver?
2005-09-30T09:30:00.000Z	linner	bob2	because x-server is failing to load
2005-09-30T09:31:00.000Z	bob2	linner	and you know that the problem is that it chose the wrong driver?
2005-09-30T09:31:00.000Z	linner	bob2	tritium knows my problems from previously... I'll see if he has a minute (or 90 to help  me! :)
2005-10-01T12:31:00.000Z	linner	bob2	why?
2005-10-01T12:31:00.000Z	linner	bob2	that's what it's there for
2005-10-01T12:32:00.000Z	bob2	linner	because the forums people operate independantly of the rest of the ubuntu world
2005-10-01T12:33:00.000Z	linner	bob2	understand you're point of view
2005-10-01T12:33:00.000Z	linner	bob2	when you said the "forum" do you mean the IRC room?
2005-10-01T12:34:00.000Z	bob2	linner	no, the web forums
2005-10-01T12:35:00.000Z	linner	bob2	oh that's a different story
2005-10-03T10:58:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 what do you know about this error:  FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Operation not permitted
2005-10-03T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	linner	that seems to be a highly useless error indicating that you need a newer version of ndiswrapper
2005-10-03T10:58:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 nice.
2005-10-03T10:58:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 just synaptic it?
2005-10-03T10:59:00.000Z	bob2	linner	no
2005-10-03T10:59:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 oh...
2005-10-03T11:00:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 what should i do then?
2005-10-03T11:00:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 go to sourceforge?
2005-10-03T11:00:00.000Z	bob2	linner	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SetupNdiswrapperHowto
2005-10-03T11:00:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 i've got that
2005-10-03T11:01:00.000Z	bob2	linner	you read that exact page?
2005-10-03T11:01:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 yes
2005-10-03T11:01:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 that's what i've been following up to this point
2005-10-03T11:01:00.000Z	bob2	linner	ouch
2005-10-03T11:01:00.000Z	linner	bob2	 i kmnow
