2012-07-02T01:35:00.000Z	harrrismrubin	ActionParsnip	 i am installing sudo apt-get install openssh-server now what
2012-07-02T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	install andftp on the tablet, liike I alrady stated... If you scroll up and reread, you'll see it
2012-07-02T01:36:00.000Z	harrrismrubin	ActionParsnip	 on ubuntu when i ran the code it came this sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2012-07-02T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	yes, that install the ssh server which also gives an sftp service...
2012-07-02T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	then your packages are not consistent
2012-07-02T01:44:00.000Z	harrrismrubin	ActionParsnip	 can i download it without terminal'

2012-07-02T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	run software centre, then you can find the app you need
2012-07-02T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	openssh-server    wasn't that massively obvious....?
2012-07-02T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	are you being serious?

2012-07-02T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	as long as openssh-server is installed it's fine
2012-07-02T01:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	yes
2012-07-02T01:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	its a service, its already running. There is nothing to 'open'

2012-07-02T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	the computer name
2012-07-02T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	you can run:  hostname   in Ubuntu, you set it when you installed the OS
2012-07-02T02:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	yes, thats your ubuntu username and pass
2012-07-02T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	you want sftp
2012-07-02T02:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	is there an option for sshfs
2012-07-02T02:14:00.000Z	harrrismrubin	ActionParsnip	 no
2012-07-02T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lysesoft.andftp&hl=en    under tthe types drop down, what do you have?
2012-07-02T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	in the conection, there is a drop down with connection types listed
2012-07-02T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	under hostname, the 2nd option?
2012-07-02T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	you are looking at your tablet, right?
2012-07-02T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	then select SFTP
2012-07-02T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	like i said earlier...abnout connexcting to sftp....
2012-07-02T02:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	you can always use the IP of the system if the hostname fails
2012-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	why do you keep asking that when I / we already know your issue? What does re-asking achieve
2012-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	yes but it can connect to sftp
2012-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	again, what does re-asking do?
2012-07-02T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	no, zero data has been transferred
2012-07-02T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	why re-ask though?
2012-07-02T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	oh jeez it's gonna be a long night, why not justread it twice
2012-07-02T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	you want sftp, you then type the IP as the host and useyour user credentials to connect and select port 22
2012-07-02T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	(2nd time so you understand) you want sftp, you then type the IP as the host and useyour user credentials to connect and select port 22
2012-07-02T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	until you get actually connected, nothing else matters
2012-07-02T02:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	is the tablet connected to the Ubuntu system now?
2012-07-02T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	then why is the transfer method impoortant if you aren't even connected?
2012-07-02T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	why do you need to know how to transfer data if the app isn't connected to the server?
2012-07-02T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	harrrismrubin	root is root
