2009-09-11T07:06:00.000Z	seidos		I think most ubuntu developers develop for ubuntu as a hobbie
2009-09-11T07:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yeah and Ubuntu isn't the only distro
2009-09-11T07:04:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	ubuntu can do this now, problem is hardware variance
2009-09-11T07:07:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I know.  What's your point?  The distros benefit each other.
2009-09-11T07:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	distros aren't all fully compatible with each other, but that's off topic here
2009-09-12T00:34:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I would think that the number of users that use LTS are probably going to give a better indicator of "mainstream" users
2009-09-12T00:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	I don't tink so,  considering that most Ubuntu users at the moment will be using 9.04 or 8.10 on the desktop
2009-09-12T00:35:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	then by mainstream I mean "not hardcore"
2009-09-12T00:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yes I mean that as well
2009-09-12T00:35:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	so do you agree that LTS users would be less hardcore?
2009-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I great alternative to booting up fast is using suspend with abandon
2009-09-12T00:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	What's this?
2009-09-12T00:50:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I rarely reboot, but I use suspend to ram
2009-09-15T01:59:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	do you have an ipod?
2009-09-15T01:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	no
2009-09-15T02:00:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I dunno why Guest got so PO'ed
2009-09-15T02:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	If you stay in here long enough like I have,  your likely to learn stuff about hardware that you don't actsualley have
2009-09-15T02:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	if you have been in here enough times I meant.
2009-09-15T02:01:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I'm trying to think of hardware that I've learned about that I don't own, but can't think of any
2009-09-15T02:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	I meant for example  the Touch, Ipod, and  ATI,   issues in 9.04
2009-09-15T02:02:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	ah, yeah, I don't have a touch or an ATI card.  I have installed ubuntu on a system with Nvidia hardware though.  Two different systems.  I don't have them anymore though (the systems).
2009-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I'd go back to 8.04 if I didn't have to use ndiswrapper for wifi
2009-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	ndiswrapper  as far as I know works in 8.04 as well
2009-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	it does, but not as good as native drivers, I got native wifi drivers in 8.10 or 9.04, can't remember which
2009-09-15T04:16:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I need to pick up the yoga mat that I have rolled up on the floor, brb
2009-09-15T04:18:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	back
2009-09-15T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	he is in a  shell,  uhmmm  read the back log?
2009-09-15T04:22:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	time
2009-09-15T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	ok  shane2peru is back,  so  they can help him I expect
2009-09-15T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	no he is  in recovery mode
2009-09-15T04:40:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	is there a way to kill xorg without rebooting?
2009-09-15T04:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	well I guess xorg isn't even running, since he is in recovery mode in one of those shells
2009-09-15T04:41:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I told him to type startx
2009-09-15T04:42:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	had I known he was in a root shell, I wouldn't have told him to do that :o
2009-09-15T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	shane2peru  was  helping him mount his external hard disk in   the recovery mode shell
2009-09-15T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	and stuff like that
2009-09-15T04:42:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	ah
2009-09-15T04:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	well I guess you got a back log,  plus   the offical log will be up soon, if it's not already,  with the stuff from earleir
2009-09-15T04:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	that was his whole problem as well,  he coudn't boot Ubuntu normalley since the xorg issue
2009-09-15T04:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	he did
2009-09-15T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	shane2peru suggested a driver for him to install ealrier
2009-09-15T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	it will be in the offical log now
2009-09-15T05:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	you mean the specs for the hardware or?
2009-09-15T05:16:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	is it an R400, R300, R800, X700
2009-09-15T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	I don't know what card he has
2009-09-15T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	however shane2peru did tell him to install a driver for his card earlier
2009-09-15T05:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	and provided a link for it
2009-09-15T05:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yes 8.04 has  a older and completly differnet  version of xorg from what 8.10 and 9.04 have
2009-09-15T05:53:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	I 2nd that
2009-09-15T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yeah good luck
2009-09-15T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	ah
2009-09-15T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yeah that's what you said earlier,   he should have someone that has the same card helping him
2009-09-15T06:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	not using your exact wording just then
2009-09-15T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	:) at the bot, and heh at you :D
2009-09-15T08:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	heh
2009-09-16T05:51:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	ethernet is great because it's so standard now.
2009-09-16T05:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yeah that's one reason why it's great
2009-09-16T06:01:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	nicely done
2009-09-16T06:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yep
2009-09-16T21:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	don't think so
2009-09-16T22:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	 can you help Nijura maybe?
2009-09-16T22:32:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	let me read their problem
2009-09-16T22:34:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	Ninjura left
2009-09-16T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	oh
2009-09-17T02:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	bro   see above at what  andyL   that could  be part of the problem,   since  Ubuntu 9.04 has some of the compiz  effects enabled by default
2009-09-17T08:48:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	any stats on ubuntu's market share?
2009-09-17T08:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	nothing proper,  they can't measure Linux market share properly,  but I guess it has about 1 or 2%
2009-09-18T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	yes that's fine your meant to have that in 9.04, but not in 9.10
2009-09-18T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	hi
2009-09-18T04:14:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	he said a fresh install of 9.10
2009-09-18T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	 hey_joe  looks like I read it wrong ok your on 9.04 not 9.10
2009-09-28T10:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	hi
2009-10-01T23:46:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	seil:  you can try out lxde by typing sudo apt-get install lxde
2009-10-01T23:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	hi
2009-10-01T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	I guess ##windows is a good place for that question
2009-11-03T03:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	someone else  had an issue with evolution in 9.10, I think they  might have lost their emails in fact
2009-11-03T03:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	wrong one
2009-11-03T03:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	I would recommend  web mail for email :)  or  Mozilla Thunderbird
2009-11-03T03:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	again hmm
2009-11-03T03:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	see above again hmm
2009-11-03T03:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	I know what you mean, but it's not always their fault
2009-11-03T04:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	well sure, but  all big programs get bugs
2009-11-03T04:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	even a lot of the smaller ones will have bugs
2010-06-18T04:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	No!
2010-06-18T04:03:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	all right all right, I'll go to ubuntu-offtopic
2010-07-02T10:25:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	that won't work, restarting doesn't fix the problem
2010-07-02T10:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	^
2010-07-02T10:26:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	what?
2010-07-02T10:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	as in above, since I messaged simon by mistake
2010-07-02T10:28:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	ah, didn't think about that.  Let me try.
2010-07-02T10:29:00.000Z	seidos	sebsebseb	thank you, adding to panel worked
2010-07-02T10:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seidos	np
