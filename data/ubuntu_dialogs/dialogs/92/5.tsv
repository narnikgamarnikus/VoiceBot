2012-10-02T05:54:00.000Z	willdabeast		I have a question regarding Precise Penguin... For some reason I have been defaulted to the 2D graphics settings and I can't find the option for 3D. The reason I need 3D is so I can use keyboard combos such as alt-tab. Anyone know a fix?
2012-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	3D does not show in the gear drop down at login, are you short a graphic driver?
2012-10-02T05:58:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	- When I go to keyboard settings, all of the bindings are disabled mostly
2012-10-02T23:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	is it mounted
2012-10-02T23:53:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	yes
2012-10-02T23:54:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	do i need to set a boot flag?
2012-10-02T23:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	whats the partition format?
2012-10-02T23:54:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ntfs with nothing on it
2012-10-02T23:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	hmm fat 32 is what you want I believe
2012-10-02T23:55:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	is it because win xp is older?
2012-10-02T23:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	ISO are generally run a fat32 and with unetbootin
2012-10-02T23:56:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	gotcha thanks :) you're always helpful.
2012-10-02T23:57:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	is your rank in the forum linked to your irc rank?
2012-10-02T23:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Not that I know of, I'm not even active on the forum, but support it.
2012-10-02T23:58:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	I saw your name on a few forum posts thats why I asked, you seemed active.
2012-10-02T23:58:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I have over 8000 posts I believe I was for some time.
2012-10-24T00:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Make sure the one OS saved has grub control if you have other OS's with grub
2012-10-24T00:23:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ok how do I check? I am really just doing this to increase the partition size of the one OS i actually use
2012-10-24T00:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	In the one you want saved run sudo grub-install /dev/sdX   X is the HD.  What ever OS is at the top of the grub list if not modified has the control.
2012-10-24T00:25:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	yea the one at the top is the one I am saving so it should have the grub
2012-10-24T00:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Yep,
2012-10-24T00:27:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I use ubuntu tweak personally to remove kernels, i could do it from the terminal or synaptic,  but I'm lazy.
2012-10-24T00:28:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	gotcha, I'll use that I suppose
2012-10-24T00:28:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	and loadid thanks :)
2012-10-24T23:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	never heard of it I think it is a personal journey man, use what works for you.
2012-10-24T23:47:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	I mean it is basically a book that shows you how to start from scratch with building a linux OS. I just thought it would be interesting and helpful for learning the background of the filesystem etc. A little more hands on
2012-10-24T23:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Might be, I learned the little I really know from using it and lurking the UF until I could help same here. I am not a person who wants to be a IT person persay though.
2012-10-25T00:12:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	you were telling me how to delete the extra kernels the other day, you said you use tweak, which part of tweak is that option?
2012-10-25T00:13:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	click the start janitor you will see the cleanup list.
2012-10-25T00:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	It will remove all but the one you are using so if you want at least two sets which is generally advised look close.
2012-10-25T00:15:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	yea I see it, well organized, I like it
2012-10-25T00:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	easy cleaning for sure.
2012-10-25T02:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	gparted will show you partitions you just have to know which is which.
2012-10-25T02:27:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	You can't lable a partition you are using from gparted though.
2012-10-25T02:27:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	I mean I've labeled them before, just given them kernel names so this wouldn't happen again
2012-10-25T02:27:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	So maybe you can give us the end goal here that might be helpful.
2012-10-25T02:28:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	essentially I am trying to get rid of one partition and resize another, I just don't wanna do the wrong ones
2012-10-25T02:29:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Ah so you don't know the partition of the OS that you want to keep?
2012-10-25T02:30:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	correct :), as well as the other one I want to resize. I have sda and sdb too (2 HD's)
2012-10-25T02:31:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	not that it's important, but it's making it a bit more confusing to me.
2012-10-25T02:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	If you run sudo update-grub it will list the OS, the one you want as I remember has grub control so the one to remove will show it's partition
2012-10-25T02:32:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	gotcha I'll give it a shot
2012-10-25T02:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Probably easier ways, I just have never been in that situation as I remember anyway, and I only know the commands I use regularly, and google for any not known. ;)
2012-10-25T02:38:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Follow Jordan_U that be some fine help. ;)
2012-10-25T02:43:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	is a swap partition necessary for just 1 OS per HD?
2012-10-25T02:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	swap has two basic uses, first if you are running the ram to the limit and second if you want to hibernate, personally I use a swap that builds itself as needed in the OS, I never hibernate.
2012-10-25T02:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I use swapspace it just makes a swap when needed in the OS, I rarely need use of a swap so it works fine for me.
2012-10-25T02:47:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	so you think 2 gb is a solid size? Even though I guess it's based on ram
2012-10-25T02:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	That would be correct I only have 2 gigs ram, and the only time it is really used is with virtualbox running.
2012-10-25T02:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	generally a swap equal to ram is suggested, unless you have a astronomical amount of ram.
2012-11-02T00:46:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	yea I know I reset unity in terminal, could that have been the issue?
2012-11-02T00:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	What release is this 12.10
2012-11-02T00:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Specificities are helpful. ;)
2012-11-02T00:35:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	my man, whats up, well for example, the way you can scroll up and down on your mousewheel on unity and it does that smooth animation. It doesn't do that very successfully any more, meaning it seems like the framerate is low.
2012-11-02T00:37:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I'm not sure I can help I use gnome 3 myself, and am in W7 at the moment. ;)
2012-11-02T00:39:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	mk well there's the problem, ubuntu just crashed due to the x server I believe. Are you very familiar with nvidia?
2012-11-02T00:40:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Not really I have never had to mess with them.
2012-11-02T00:44:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	you may be able to help with the second part of ^
2012-11-02T00:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I would say that messing with compiz can cause problems, ou can reset it to stock though.
2012-11-02T00:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I can't say if it is the root of the problem though.
2012-11-02T00:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	You want to run that command from a alt-f2 not the terminal.
2012-11-02T00:48:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ahhh, so do you think that is the root of the problem? or at least for the unity issue?
2012-11-02T00:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	as well there is compiz --replace to reset it.  Not sure as far as all the problems
2012-11-02T00:49:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ok I think that should work, should both commands be done in alt f2? or does compiz not matter
2012-11-02T00:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I gave up on unity and compiz about a year ago.
2012-11-02T00:50:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	what are you using now? docky or something?
2012-11-02T00:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	gnome 3 and cairo dock
2012-11-02T00:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	the gnome-shell
2012-11-02T00:51:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	hmm I'd be willing to try that out, Unity still feels like it's in beta to me.
2012-11-02T00:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Honestly I use synapse to find apps usually and the cairo-dock for the stuff I open often.
2012-11-02T00:53:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	yea I do have synapse, It's just sitting there right now though haha, wouldn't mind using it for once.
2012-11-02T00:55:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	any place in particular to find gnome 3? I think at this point you already know how new I am to this stuff
2012-11-02T00:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	If you want to install it, sudo apt-get install gnome-shell  you also get the gnome fallback with kit as well the pseudo gnome 2 desktop as a choice in the login drop down
2012-11-02T00:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Unity actually sits on top of gnome 3 so the shell is just a few more pckgs.
2012-11-02T00:57:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	well apparently I already have it *facepalm*
2012-11-02T00:57:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	haha yea I guess I'm good then, just need cairo and to get rid of the excess.
2012-11-02T01:00:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	any particular way I should remove unity and compiz? I feel like everything I try and get rid of on here is like removing an antivirus program on windows.
2012-11-02T01:00:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I would not remove them they are rather small, and doing this is just a problem waiting to happen with dependencies.
2012-11-02T01:01:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ok well I guess I will just reset them then like you said, btw cairo is awesome great call.
2012-11-02T01:01:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I like the cairo-dock as far as docks go.
2012-11-02T01:04:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	so is there anyway to at least make unity not visible? I'd rather not have 2 docks
2012-11-02T01:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	Try the gnome shell that is where I use the cairo-dock.
2012-11-02T01:06:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ah so you mean at login just changing there, gotcha. Thanks bud :]
2012-11-02T01:45:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	do you know much about changing the icons on cairo? Essentially I wanted to just replace the program 'guake' with the terminal program but leaving the terminal icon there.
2012-11-02T01:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I forget if I did. ;)
2012-11-02T01:46:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	haha alright, not that important thanks.
2012-11-02T01:50:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	have you tried cairo-dock 3.1?
2012-11-02T04:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	I would use the cli and apt-fast.
2012-11-02T04:32:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	for what?
2012-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	For getting apps, it is faster, but if your looking for a gui you can try deepin.
2012-11-02T04:33:00.000Z	willdabeast	wilee-nilee	ah alright thanks
2012-11-02T06:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	willdabeast	^^^^ as wildc4rd
