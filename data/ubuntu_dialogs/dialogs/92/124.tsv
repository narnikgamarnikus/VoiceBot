2004-09-27T05:47:00.000Z	maswan		Hmm.. Are the torrents in need of additional seeds?
2004-09-27T05:48:00.000Z	maswan		hi there jdub 
2004-09-27T05:48:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	not really, I think..  my i386 seed is running with ~1.3Mbit up
2004-09-27T05:48:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	ACK
2004-09-27T05:49:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	and we're more or less on the same net, I guess. :P
2004-09-27T05:49:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Yeah
2004-09-27T05:50:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	no fai/jumpstart/roboinst/nim or other automagic network install stuff yet in here?
2004-10-04T05:04:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	there, finally I'm managing to burn a cd. took a while to get a working device or so.
2004-10-04T05:04:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	attacking ravel now?
2004-10-04T05:06:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	That's the plan, in a few minutes anyway.
2004-10-04T05:06:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	ook, wiping out people's ~?
2004-10-04T05:28:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Nope, the plan is to keep both that and the chroots.
2004-10-04T05:28:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	To be sure, I'm going to install with out the current $HOME-disk plugged in. :)
2004-10-04T05:29:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	ok, goodie
2004-10-04T05:29:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	you mean plugged in or typo?
2004-10-05T12:40:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	sorry about that, didn't get around to it. hopefully next week.
2004-10-05T15:08:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	np, ok. :)
2004-10-08T08:23:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	you around?
2004-10-08T09:44:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	yes
2004-10-08T10:17:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Just thought I saw some references here, are there any x40 models to avoid or are the current ones all equally good?
2004-10-08T10:17:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	I think they all work well
2004-10-08T10:18:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	basically, it's all the same machine, but with/without bluetooth, wlan, different-sized battery
2004-10-08T10:18:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Ok, not 25 different wlan types or something evil like that then.
2004-10-08T10:18:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	you should possibly talk to mjg59 or thom, they both have it.
2004-10-08T10:18:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Ok.
2004-10-08T10:18:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I just rembered you talking about it. :)
2004-10-08T10:23:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	mjg59, daniels, thom: thanks, I appriciate the info
2004-10-09T05:55:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	The installer kernel logs a gazillion dma errors and stuff regarding mptbase when creating filesystems, a process which is very slow. Familiar problem?
2004-10-09T09:21:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	on ravel?
2004-10-09T09:58:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	yes. it was so bad that it didn't really manage to write most pages to disk
2004-10-09T10:01:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	checking the disk with badblocks now
2004-10-09T10:13:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	seems to be working perfectly now, so an issue with the install kernel probably.
2004-10-09T10:13:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I'll let it run badblocks over the night anyway, more stuff tomorrow
2004-10-10T11:13:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	let me know when you have fixed the problem and give me a link to an iso and I'll try another install
2004-10-10T12:51:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	ping?
2004-10-10T12:53:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	pong
2004-10-10T12:53:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I verified the disk with badblocks -w, no problems at all
2004-10-10T12:53:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	what is the problem?
2004-10-10T12:54:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I can't create filesystems. Syslog says lots of stuff regarding mptbase getting dma timeouts and so on with the occasional "page lost due to write fail" or similar in .err
2004-10-10T12:55:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	what kind of controller?
2004-10-10T12:55:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	lspci on ravel? :)
2004-10-10T12:55:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	mptfusion
2004-10-10T12:56:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	hm, weird.. try mkfs-ing beforehand?
2004-10-10T12:57:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Well, it seems to be a generic "I can't write to disk" failure
2004-10-10T12:58:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Nope, not yet at least.
2004-10-10T12:58:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	I'd try that and see if it's a normal kernel regression or a ubuntu error
2004-10-10T12:59:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	ACK, I'll look for time to do that soon then.
2004-10-10T13:00:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	goodie; want me to compile a kernel you can just pop in?
2004-10-10T13:00:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	yeah, I'd appriciate that
2004-10-15T16:37:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	btw, regarding that, did you get around to compile a kernel?
2004-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	oh, sorry. /:
2004-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I'll do it now then
2004-10-15T16:43:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	ok
2004-10-15T06:20:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Ok, hopefully ravel will come up now. :)
2004-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	"now booting kernel" and then nothing more. Time for a second try then. :/
2004-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	yeah, guess so..
2004-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	around? I got another amd64 bug now
2004-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	grub: "selected item cannot fit into memory" or something like that.
2004-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	(I tried on one of the dl145s instead of ravel)
2004-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	hm, using the preview or a daily?
2004-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	preview
2004-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	known issue; use a daily
2004-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Ok.
2004-10-19T08:37:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	if it's not fixed in the dailies, file a bug, assign it to me and whine loudly. :)
2004-10-19T08:40:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	btw, I just got a cd/dvd burner in my workstation at work, so now I won't have to crawl down to a collegues machine in another office. ;)
2004-10-19T08:41:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	nice. :)  I'm considering getting a DVD dual-layer, external USB+firewire recorder thingy..
2004-10-19T08:46:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	;)
2004-10-19T08:53:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	dunno, haven't checked that. I run default woody 686 kernel on my workstation.
2004-10-19T08:58:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	is there an easy option for "no, don't copy all packages to the hd"?
2004-10-19T08:58:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	at the end of the first install section?
2004-10-19T09:00:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	there's some debconf param when booting, I don't remember.
2004-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	Ok, that worked. I guess the graphical stuff is more rewarding if you have a mouse though. :)
2004-10-19T09:23:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	use "custom" at the start of the installer to go custom. :P
2004-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I'm a bit miffed about getting the wrong keyboard mappings though, but that install won't live long enough for me to care really. :)
2004-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	it should be correct, I'd think..
2004-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	I chose english language but location Sweden... it appears that the logic assumes language = keyboard?
2004-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	file a wishlist bug?
2004-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	or prod Kamion until he fixes it. :P
2004-10-19T09:28:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	we have mr. Bugzilla on board, though. :)
2004-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	how about a bts-compatible email interface? :)
2004-10-19T09:30:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	we'll hopefully get an email interface at some point, but Not Ready Yet :/
2004-10-19T09:47:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	is there any difference in kernel for amd64 on the daily/current and the preview? That is, is there any point of me trying it on ravel?
2004-10-19T09:47:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	I don't know, actually.
2004-10-19T09:50:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	aren't you supposed to know? :)
2004-10-19T09:51:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	I'm not the one doing kernels, but I don't _think_ there has been any kernel update.
2004-10-19T09:53:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	well, that's enough for today anyway. perhaps next week. :)
2004-10-28T16:09:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	your timezone is just wrong. :)
2004-10-28T16:09:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	yes. :)
2004-10-29T06:08:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	you're late :)
2004-10-29T06:09:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	nah, I was before on my screen, slow IRC net, you know. :)
2004-10-29T06:10:00.000Z	maswan	Mithrandir	ok, so we need a free and independant poll to answer this importan question
2004-10-29T06:11:00.000Z	Mithrandir	maswan	:)
