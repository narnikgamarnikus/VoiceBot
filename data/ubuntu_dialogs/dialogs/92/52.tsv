2008-12-15T17:38:00.000Z	peleg		I am having a very serious issue, suddenly -- every video I watch now, whether it is .mov or .avi is really dark, and of negative colours. It started only a few minutes ago, after a restart, and ever since -- new restarts don't fix this problem.
2008-12-15T17:39:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	what media player and what video output? and what vga are you on?
2008-12-15T17:39:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	ANY media player I am using displays it like that (mplayer, totem, vlc). what do you mean by "what video output" or "what vga"?
2008-12-15T17:41:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	media players have a video output. xv is by default. its location in the options depends on the player. vga is the graphics card you have
2008-12-15T17:41:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	but how can I check that, in order to answer you? And -- why would it change -- here is, I only restarted my computer
2008-12-15T17:42:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	well you can look at the media players options for the video output. and i also need the graphics card too. to find it             lspci | grep VGA
2008-12-15T17:43:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	thanks for your help. First answer (out of two): 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
2008-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	I couldn't find an answer to the second question, but here's mplayer's output, maybe it helps: http://paste.freeallweb.org/90
2008-12-15T17:50:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	are you good enough with the terminal so as to start a movie with mplayer from it?
2008-12-15T17:51:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	yes, I am "good enough" with the terminal. Actually, it's Gnome that I am not "good enough" with (hence I try to use as many command-line programs as possible, instead of gui ones)
2008-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	try this then                  mplayer -vo x11 file.avi
2008-12-15T17:52:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	see how it goes
2008-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	and continue with other video output methods ( -vo) like xv, gl and gl2
2008-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	very good!
2008-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	so, something messed with my default vo ?
2008-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	it does play with xv normally?
2008-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	xv is bad
2008-12-15T17:54:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	well can you full screen it with x11? F is the shortcut key for it
2008-12-15T17:54:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	gl and gl2 are good
2008-12-15T17:55:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	does x11 fullscreen properly? i get a strange border when i do it in mine
2008-12-15T17:55:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	it keeps a black frame around it - it does not enlarge the picture. also, using -gui it did not work
2008-12-15T17:55:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	best overal use is xv, then x11, then gl and gl2
2008-12-15T17:55:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	go with gl then
2008-12-15T17:56:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	wait, but what happened with xv ?
2008-12-15T17:56:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	i think it is some driver parameter for it. only nvidias work perfectly with xv :(
2008-12-15T17:58:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	but now when I double click a movie in Gnome, or try -gui in mplayer command line, so I have to use x11 and it is (suddenly!) not wroking
2008-12-15T17:58:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	there is somewhere in preferences. look it up
2008-12-15T18:00:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	in the preferneces of what? of mplayer + totem + vlc + ... ?
2008-12-15T18:01:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	mplayer at first. find that and make sure it works and you can do the rest later
2008-12-15T18:03:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	but do you realise that something is not proper here? One of two things happened here: a. the default preferneces of *all* of my video software had changed, or b. something general has happened. I want to solve the general thing, assuming that this is probably the thing that had happened
2008-12-15T18:04:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	the default preferences of all players are xv video output! one bad thing in sv affects all.
2008-12-15T18:05:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	ok, so that's what I prefer to solve. xv worked just fine, then, until 1 hour ago. Why should it kill itself just like that, after a restart?
2008-12-15T18:06:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	were the intel drivers updated? or xorg itself?
2008-12-15T18:06:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	how can I know that? I don't think so, but could it be that it happened without letting me know?
2008-12-15T18:08:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	I think I have reinstalled totem before the restart, but I am not sure it was before *that* restart
2008-12-15T18:08:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	 sudo cat /var/log/dpkg.log | tail
2008-12-15T18:08:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	nice! here: 2008-12-15 12:15:26 status unpacked totem-gstreamer 2.20.0-0ubuntu3
2008-12-15T18:09:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	any other lines?
2008-12-15T18:09:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	yes, all related. I'll paste it
2008-12-15T18:09:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	pastebin them if possible
2008-12-15T18:10:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	http://paste.freeallweb.org/91
2008-12-15T18:10:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	or maybe you want a longer tail?
2008-12-15T18:10:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	yes please
2008-12-15T18:12:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	http://paste.freeallweb.org/92 <-- this is the longest relevant tail, I believe
2008-12-15T18:13:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	give me a sec.
2008-12-15T18:14:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	I am not in a hurry, take your time. thanks for your help!
2008-12-15T18:18:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	sudo cat /var/log/apt/term.log | tail                this tells it in a more apt way, can you please do that too? and add a bigger tail of like 50
2008-12-15T18:19:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	sure
2008-12-15T18:21:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	http://paste.freeallweb.org/93
2008-12-15T18:23:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	well it seems clean.... unless that package removal made a mess gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse
2008-12-15T18:23:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	so, what do you recommend? should I uninstall most of these and reinstall them?
2008-12-15T18:26:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	why uninstall? and what to uninstall? does gstreamer-properties work for you?
2008-12-15T18:26:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	I thought that if I'll try to revert the changes that I've maid, the "mess" will be reorganised... I'll try gstreamer-properties
2008-12-15T18:27:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	in video tab, what do you get under defautl output?
2008-12-15T18:28:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	plugin: autodetect
2008-12-15T18:29:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	can you change it to xv or the one below it?
2008-12-15T18:30:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	yes. should I do it? and then what?
2008-12-15T18:30:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	then try totem and vlc again
2008-12-15T18:31:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	funny, there's this testing button; when I chose "no xv", the test gives me colours from left (bright) to right (dark), and something moves as well; when I chose the second option (X11/.../xv) the test seems to give me negative colours
2008-12-15T18:32:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	lol
2008-12-15T18:32:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	i get the same colort
2008-12-15T18:33:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	so, we didn't solve the problem, but we know exactly what caused it
2008-12-15T18:34:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	true :(
2008-12-15T18:39:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	hey, watch this:
2008-12-15T18:39:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	oops, here it is: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/32963
2008-12-15T18:40:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	thats hilarious!
2008-12-15T18:40:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	indeed. I am still reading
2008-12-15T18:49:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	haha!!! do you know what solved the problem? watching the movie, and *while* the movie is working (but not before), running a command that will modify xv-attributes, and then it changed everything back to normal. It is said there that if I'll run totem again, it will be bad again. I won't run totem, then!!
2008-12-15T18:49:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	i use mplayer and i dont trust any gstreamer frontend like totem and kaffeine
2008-12-15T18:50:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	yes, I also use only mplayer; but I thought that I'll need this totem (hence I installed it) to watch that m4v...
2008-12-15T18:50:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	my mplayer does play m4v!
2008-12-15T18:50:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	really? I'll try that again, then
2008-12-15T18:51:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	not any mplayer! THE mplayer... from the medibuntu repo
2008-12-15T18:52:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	what do you mean? how do I know which mplayer do I have at the moment? I don't think I have medibuntu in my sources list
2008-12-15T18:53:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	remove the one you have now. put the medibuntu repo in your sources. clean apt cach and it will install mplayer from there
2008-12-15T18:54:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	you know what, I am not sure I need it. I am sending this video to my windows-based a-technological family, so I think that re-encoding it as .avi will be the best thing to do anyway...
2008-12-15T18:55:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	or you can give your family a nice mplayer frontend for windows, like gomplayer, and save yourself the time and effort
2008-12-15T18:56:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	haha! no, it's my extended family. I don't know which laptop they'll bring to the party, and I am not going to check that out... it'll take more time. jim_p: things are even more complicated than that: I live in London, they live in Israel. anyway, trust me -- I believe that re-encoding it will be the best thing to do ;-)
2008-12-15T18:57:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	ok
2008-12-15T19:11:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	ok mplayer (without medibuntu) *does* play the m4v, but with weird gray embossing in the first few seconds... :(  -- though, I have discovered that vlc plays it right. I can't get ffmpeg to transfer it to avi -- but if I can play it, sure something decodes it, right?
2008-12-15T19:12:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	what embossing?
2008-12-15T19:12:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	it just looks gray in the beginning
2008-12-15T19:13:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	does it appear for long?
2008-12-15T19:14:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	just a few seconds. though, if I run-forward, than it stays with me, and actually cause some bugs either
2008-12-15T19:15:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	let me look at my video of the same kind
2008-12-15T19:23:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	do you think medibuntu has a different version of ffmpeg as well?
2008-12-15T19:23:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	i dont think, it DOES
2008-12-15T19:24:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	I see. maybe I'll give it a try then. how did you say? purge, clean cache, update source list, install ?
2008-12-15T19:25:00.000Z	jim_p	peleg	yes
2008-12-15T19:25:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	thanks; and what is the url for that repo?
2008-12-15T19:27:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	thanks
2008-12-15T19:32:00.000Z	peleg	jim_p	I am following their tutorial, but again and again I am stuck in this phase: " sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get update"
