2010-06-26T18:47:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	report back when you have zenmap open and ready to fire
2010-06-26T18:39:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	define localhost
2010-06-26T18:40:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	when I type localhost on my ubuntu instance into a browser.. it hits apache on port 80
2010-06-26T18:40:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	apache running on the guest system you mean ?
2010-06-26T18:40:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	and you expected it to hit port 80 on your host system  ?
2010-06-26T18:41:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	because that ip you just mentioned is the ip of your guest system as seen from inside the virtualised lan ... not your host system.
2010-06-26T18:41:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	ah I see, how do I find outside? ipconfig in windows?
2010-06-26T18:41:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	the ip of the virtual router that separates your host and the guest lan is 10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T18:42:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	I tried 10.0.2.2 as wel and that didn't do anything either :(
2010-06-26T18:42:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	yes that would be one way... but windows does not show the vbox device in network places right ?
2010-06-26T18:42:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	I see something called VirtualBox Host-Only Network
2010-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	under network connections.. does that count?
2010-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	you need to set your guest system to use NAT
2010-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	so 1) power it off (don't perform a snapshot) 2) edit the settings of the network device 3) change it to NAT
2010-06-26T18:44:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	is that not the same?
2010-06-26T18:44:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	ok. when you power it up. is it able to ping google.com ?
2010-06-26T18:45:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	cehck the firewall settings you might have running on the host system
2010-06-26T18:45:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	I was just going to ask that
2010-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	have any experience with COMODO ? :)
2010-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i would also use nmap from the guest and scan the 10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	yes it's ok
2010-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i forget the exact procedure to open ports though
2010-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	never used nmap, what do I do? Also, how do I know if COMODO is blocking 10.0.2.2?
2010-06-26T18:46:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	in your guest : sudo apt-get install nmap zenmap
2010-06-26T18:48:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	hmm says I'm trying to run zenmap as a non-root user... is that a problem?
2010-06-26T18:48:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	1) alt + f2 2) type : gksudo zenmap
2010-06-26T18:48:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	or gksudo zenmap from a terminal window
2010-06-26T18:48:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	there we go :)
2010-06-26T18:49:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	ok 1) top left text field you put : 10.0.2.2 2) top right field select intensive scan
2010-06-26T18:49:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	then hit scan
2010-06-26T18:50:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	https://gist.github.com/bf0ac2fbc0007bb1cc03
2010-06-26T18:51:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	ok so in firefox on the guest what happens when you visit : http://10.0.2.2:80
2010-06-26T18:51:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	using chrome, is that an issue? :)
2010-06-26T18:52:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i wouldn't think so
2010-06-26T18:52:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	says oops! This link appears to be broken
2010-06-26T18:52:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	(i also assume you have a correctly configured apache server running on your host ? )
2010-06-26T18:52:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	yes, when I visit localhost, it hits my application
2010-06-26T18:52:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	same when you visit 10.0.2.2 from host ?
2010-06-26T18:53:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	yes, even with port omitted, it still doesn't bring up 10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T18:53:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i think i remember reading about port forwarding requires the use of a vbox cli tool
2010-06-26T18:54:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	although im not sure its necessary
2010-06-26T18:54:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	:( lol
2010-06-26T18:54:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	was that an intensive sacn using zenmap ?
2010-06-26T18:54:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	seems to be missing information
2010-06-26T18:55:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	it was an intense scan without any extras
2010-06-26T18:55:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	there is an intense scan option with all TCP ports
2010-06-26T18:55:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	and an intense scan + UDP
2010-06-26T18:55:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	it's been a really long time since i've bothered to use windows as a vbox host
2010-06-26T18:55:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	o crap
2010-06-26T18:56:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	yeah one of the extras it does is tests the port for reply data... on a http server port it would elicit a http server response
2010-06-26T18:56:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	https://gist.github.com/bf0ac2fbc0007bb1cc03
2010-06-26T18:57:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	did the extra stuff help?
2010-06-26T18:57:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	ok so from your guest system open a file browser and press ctrl + l
2010-06-26T18:58:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	then in the text field type : smb://10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T18:58:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	Could not display "smb:///10.0.2.2".
2010-06-26T18:58:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	ok.
2010-06-26T18:58:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	Error: Failed to retrieve share list from server
2010-06-26T18:58:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	check you only have two / not three
2010-06-26T18:59:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	two which?
2010-06-26T18:59:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	ah good call
2010-06-26T19:00:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	password required for 10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T19:00:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i assume it should work because on line 104 of your last gist shows that it can communicate with services on your host
2010-06-26T19:00:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	which password is it?
2010-06-26T19:00:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	its the password you use to loginto windows i think
2010-06-26T19:01:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	should I have it remember?
2010-06-26T19:01:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	not for now
2010-06-26T19:01:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	ok I see ADMIN$ C$ and Users
2010-06-26T19:02:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	it doesn't really matter though, because that fact that its asking for authentication means that your guest can communicate with server processes on your host. so there is something up with your apache config on your host
2010-06-26T19:02:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i would check that your apache config is set to listen to all interfaces and not just the real network card on your machine
2010-06-26T19:03:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i'm not familiar with the variation of apache you might be using on windows but default of apache server in ubuntu is that it listens for http requests on port 80 from any interface
2010-06-26T19:04:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	well. there. i thought you had apache running on windows too.
2010-06-26T19:04:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	which leads me to ask : what is the problem you are having if it isn't that you can't connect to your host ?
2010-06-26T19:04:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	that is blasphemy ;)
2010-06-26T19:05:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	I want to access my virtualbox's apache from windows
2010-06-26T19:06:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	it should work. let me ask this question i asked before : from windows in a browser what happens when you visit http://10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T19:07:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	it hangs for a bit in chrome and then says Oops! Google Chrome cannot connect to 10.0.2.2
2010-06-26T19:07:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	ok i do indeed think you need to do port forwarding with vbox cli tools on windows (since it just a router configuration that is getting in the wy)
2010-06-26T19:09:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	im not sure how relevant the information here is but this is the general thing to do (from your host ) http://mydebian.blogdns.org/?p=111
2010-06-26T19:10:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/12/17/configure-port-forwarding-to-a-virtualbox-guest-os/
2010-06-26T19:10:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i think that last link is more relevant
2010-06-26T19:11:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	thx! I will read
2010-06-26T19:12:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	just remember virtualbox has changed a bit since two years ago so it might actually be alot simplier than explained in those pages
2010-06-26T19:13:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-port-forwarding-virtualbox-vboxmanage
2010-06-26T19:14:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	it seems that you need to make your apache server listen on a port higher than 1024 so that you can port forward without crashing the guest on startup (port forwarding ports below 1024 without root access will crash the guest)
2010-06-26T19:15:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	do I need to shutdown the guest OS to access CLI?
2010-06-26T19:15:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	i think so , yes.
2010-06-26T19:16:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	although i wouldn't really know.
2010-06-26T19:16:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	;) We're creeping out of scope hehe
2010-06-26T19:20:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	good luck
2010-06-26T19:27:00.000Z	d2dchat	airtonix	not sure how to access VBoxManage inside of Windows haha
2010-06-26T19:27:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	press the windows key and R together
2010-06-26T19:28:00.000Z	airtonix	d2dchat	then type cmd in the text field, press enter
