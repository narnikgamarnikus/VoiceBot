2009-01-20T22:31:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	Type "sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.09-pkg1.run"
2009-01-20T22:31:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	but you need to be at command prompt in the directory where file was saved
2009-01-20T22:33:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	- can you get to a command prompt in console or terminal?

2009-01-20T22:42:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	did it complain about x running?
2009-01-20T22:42:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	k ... x = point and click environment
2009-01-20T22:43:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	kill x then do that

2009-01-20T22:54:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	how old/slow it that machine?
2009-01-20T22:55:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you hit enter after you typed in the command right - lol?
2009-01-20T22:56:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	type ls and hit enter and tell me what happens
2009-01-20T22:57:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	no x
2009-01-20T22:57:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	hit ctrl+c
2009-01-20T22:59:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	did you use control c to stop the sh command?
2009-01-20T23:02:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	there is a way to do evrey thing in linux
2009-01-20T23:03:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	is that machine still running?
2009-01-20T23:03:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	use tab completion... like this
2009-01-20T23:04:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	nan(tab)(space)et(tab)X(tab)xorg(tab) do not hit enter and tell me what it says
2009-01-20T23:05:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	do that at a username@username-desktop prompt
2009-01-20T23:06:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you command should look like nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-01-20T23:07:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	if it does not you need to reinstall
2009-01-20T23:08:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	if you used the tab key it would not say new file
2009-01-20T23:08:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	how many partitions are there?
2009-01-20T23:09:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	wipe and reinstall
2009-01-20T23:11:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you should be able to select a option from grub to get x working out of the box... then it is just the one file from nvidia you need to run... it edit's xorg.conf automatically
2009-01-20T23:27:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you rebooted cd with default options?
2009-01-20T23:28:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	there is an option to boot live cd in vesa mode correct?
2009-01-20T23:29:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	reboot the cd again and hit the down arrow key (to stop auto starting) and tell me what options you have.
2009-01-20T23:31:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	do the safe graphics mode and tell me what happens
2009-01-20T23:32:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	what kind of video card do you have?
2009-01-20T23:33:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	exactly the same card here - I'd do the install
2009-01-20T23:34:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	ok the select the try - there is an install option from the live boot
2009-01-20T23:35:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	k
2009-01-20T23:38:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	ok - so you are installing ok now?
2009-01-20T23:41:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	I am going for a smoke - lemme know when it is installed... I would recomend the point and click method to install nvidia drivers before you edit (fux it up) you xorg.conf... and see if that works and if not do the manual install of drivers before xorg.conf gets messed.
2009-01-20T23:42:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	is it copying files yet?
2009-01-20T23:43:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	it should have told you it was partitioning and formating
2009-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you left it at default install options?
2009-01-20T23:44:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you need to use entire disk if there is nothing else on it
2009-01-20T23:45:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	cancel the install and start again - no need to reboot tho
2009-01-20T23:46:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	it should be able to be cancelled
2009-01-20T23:49:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	correct
2009-01-20T23:49:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	were you asking or telling?
2009-01-20T23:51:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	good to go = can I go for a smoke now ?
2009-01-20T23:52:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	lol -  brb... I gotta return some phone calls, see you in a bit.
2009-01-21T00:17:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	what's up?
2009-01-21T00:18:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you still here?
2009-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	cool = so all is good?
2009-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	are you talking about grub menu?
2009-01-21T00:21:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	you will want that there... yes that is to edit the list
2009-01-21T00:22:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	when you system updates your kernel you will have an option there to boot the new (default) or the old fer when things get messed - lol
2009-01-21T00:22:00.000Z	dougiel	farf	do you like the mac?
