2009-03-25T13:33:00.000Z	hummahumma		hey
2009-03-25T13:34:00.000Z	hummahumma		how can i exit x server?
2009-03-25T13:34:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	ctrl +alt + backspace
2009-03-25T13:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	you completely want to turn it off? sudo  /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-03-25T13:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	exactly
2009-03-25T13:37:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	what terminal screen?
2009-03-25T13:37:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	what are you actually trying to accomplish?
2009-03-25T13:38:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	well that is linux running without x-server, isn't that what you wanted?
2009-03-25T13:38:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	depends on whether you do that from within the restricted drivers dialog or if you manually install them
2009-03-25T13:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	if you manually install them sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop is the command that you are looking for, execute this from a console which you can access with ctrl+alt+F1 to F6
2009-03-25T13:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	exactly
2009-03-25T13:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	envy imho is bogus like hell, dont recommend that..
2009-03-25T13:42:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	then you dont really have it running
2009-03-25T13:43:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	you are aware that there is a dialog in system/administration called hardware drivers where ubuntu does that for you?
2009-03-25T13:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	install graphics drivers AND configure graphics card
2009-03-25T13:44:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	you might also sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings which is a graphical interface with which you can customize the driver
2009-03-25T13:45:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	have you already had a look into system/administration/hardware drivers?
2009-03-25T13:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	well problem might be that if you install the drivers manually you might have to add the drivers name to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-03-25T14:02:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	pleas past your /etc/x11/xorg.conf to www.nopaste.org
2009-03-25T14:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	yes please
2009-03-25T14:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	ok, gimme a sec
2009-03-25T14:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	hummkay as i thought you got a little messup there, i suggest the folowing: the driver that you installed has a remove option, do remove the driver on the commandline then again enable it in the hardware drivers menu, if you are lucky it works after that
2009-03-25T14:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	as i said the script that installs the driver has a remove option, i havent memorized exacly which one it is but try --remove
2009-03-25T14:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	exactly
2009-03-25T14:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	then go to system/administration/hardware drivers once more and enable it there
2009-03-25T14:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	disable and enable it
2009-03-25T14:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	if that does not work do sudo dpkg -reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-03-25T14:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	yes it is!
2009-03-25T14:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	that is a good sign cos that is the driver that it wants to install
2009-03-25T14:15:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	NO that command cleans your xorg.conf you dont want that to happen now!
2009-03-25T14:16:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	but you need to restart the computer now in order to have the driver running
2009-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	working now?
2009-03-25T14:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	which one?
2009-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	errr. that is not an error message:D what is the precise statement?
2009-03-25T14:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	huh??
2009-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	i have no idea, if that is your card it probably should have...
2009-03-25T14:24:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	could help, yes
2009-03-25T14:34:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	not good... basically this happens sometimes if you try and install nvidia drivers manually, i had that once and i had it until i reinstalled ubuntu, cos i gave up after tinkering arround with it for like three days...
2009-03-25T14:34:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	nope that is imho not the point
2009-03-25T14:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	rm???
2009-03-25T14:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	none that i currently know of, except if you reinstall DON'T install them manually again....
2009-03-25T14:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	sure as hell is;)
2009-03-25T15:27:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	what is t\ ?
2009-03-25T15:28:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	why is that?
2009-03-25T15:29:00.000Z	hummahumma	remoteCTRL1	administration>network
2009-03-25T15:33:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	ya that i understand... i suggest you get the machine over here?
2009-03-25T15:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	well if you cant donwload the driver you got a problem...
2009-03-25T15:41:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	soory, no idea...
2009-03-25T15:42:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	np:)
2009-03-25T15:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	sorry dude but i got absolutely no experience with proxies...
2009-03-25T15:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	sudo gedit <file>
2009-03-25T16:01:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	why not
2009-03-25T16:04:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	if you want to acces system files via nautilus you need to open nautilus with gksudo nautilus, then you also may access system files
2009-03-25T16:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	err you did just reinstall ubuntu if i am not mistaken?
2009-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	hell and already broken?:D
2009-03-25T16:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	well i already did tell you both ways
2009-03-25T16:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	if not with gedit you can try and access it with sudo nano <file>
2009-03-25T16:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	ya then you got a filebrowser with root access
2009-03-25T16:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	then you can open all files, also system files
2009-03-25T16:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	why not? still permission denied?
2009-03-25T16:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	you do the SUDO infront of the command, right?
2009-03-25T16:10:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	no idea dude, i can open it without any problems...
2009-03-25T16:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	i told you GKSUDO not sudo nautilus;)
2009-03-25T16:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	of course i can
2009-03-25T16:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	so then you should see a filebrowser now whcih has root access
2009-03-25T16:12:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	that would be the purpuose of the comman, yes
2009-03-25T16:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	do you enter the command into the console or into alt+f2?
2009-03-25T16:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	hehehe
2009-03-25T16:23:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	roflol dude ALWAYS backup the file before tinkering;)
2009-03-25T16:24:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	sure
2009-03-25T16:25:00.000Z	hummahumma	remoteCTRL1	   bash: /etc/bash.bashrc: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `(' bash: /etc/bash.bashrc: line 1: `ï»¿# System-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells.'
2009-03-25T16:27:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	http://nopaste.org/p/at0xwU2Thb
2009-03-25T16:29:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	err i dont see how open office is related to bashrc?
2009-03-25T16:34:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	ah! ya that can very well be
2009-03-25T16:34:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	use gedit or use nano oder use vi(the latter if you are a masochist) to do such jobs;)
2009-03-25T17:03:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	aw yeah:D
2009-03-25T17:03:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	well then enable the driver in system/administration/hardware drivers
2009-03-25T17:06:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	well sure it is, what else should it download;)
2009-03-25T17:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	dont forget to reboot after installation;)
2009-03-25T17:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	no, no problems with that
2009-03-25T17:13:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	hummahumma	hehehe np man, glad to help;)
