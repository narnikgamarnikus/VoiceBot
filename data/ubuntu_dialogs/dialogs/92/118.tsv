2005-05-14T12:00:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		how do get my ubuntu machine to actually broadcast its 'client hostname' to the rest of the lan? its a printer server on dhcp and i want to be able to print to it without giving its IP at the time
2005-05-14T12:01:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	what kind of a setup is that? :)
2005-05-14T13:06:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u need DNS
2005-05-14T13:07:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	so what?
2005-05-14T13:07:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u steel need dns
2005-05-14T13:07:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	how do i use this DNS mastery? why doesnt ubuntu do it be default? archlinux does, and it does NOTHING for me by default
2005-05-14T13:07:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u are wrong, man
2005-05-14T13:08:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	no software knows what computers are on network
2005-05-14T13:08:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	what i plug in 192.168.1.1 into my browser and look at my routers setup, i can click on "dhcp table" and it shows me a "client hostname" for every computer connected EXCEPT for the ubuntu machine
2005-05-14T13:09:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	?
2005-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	am i REALLY an idiot?
2005-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	yes
2005-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	go to /etc/dhcp3 dir
2005-05-14T13:17:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	and remove comment "send host-name"
2005-05-14T13:17:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	/etc/dhcpc?
2005-05-14T13:18:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	/etc/dhcp3/
2005-05-14T13:18:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	there is file dhclient.conf
2005-05-14T13:18:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	sorry
2005-05-14T13:19:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	cool. then what's the ubuntu equivalent of /etc/rc.d/network restart?
2005-05-14T13:19:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u don't need to do that
2005-05-14T13:20:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u can try ifup eth0 down and then ifup eth0 up
2005-05-14T13:20:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	oh yeah
2005-05-14T13:27:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	grrrrr. didnt work
2005-05-14T13:27:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	yes it did
2005-05-14T13:28:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	lol. no
2005-05-14T13:28:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	ur dhcp server now knows the name of ur host
2005-05-14T13:28:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	but that doesn't mean that u can ping that machine by it's hostname
2005-05-14T13:28:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u need DNS for that
2005-05-14T13:29:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i beg to differ
2005-05-14T13:29:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i edited the file, ifdown'ed and ifup'ed...
2005-05-14T13:30:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	now check out ur DHCP server and search for ur hostname
2005-05-14T13:31:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i went to dhclient.conf, commented out the line "send host-name "andare.fugue.com"" (NO idea where that line came from), ifdown'ed if up'ed. and checked my router's dhcp client table..
2005-05-14T13:31:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u fool
2005-05-14T13:32:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	why didn't u put in ur hostname??
2005-05-14T13:32:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	why should it make a difference?
2005-05-14T13:32:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	do i put my hostname in "s?
2005-05-14T13:32:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	put in ur hostname without .xx.com
2005-05-14T13:32:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	ifdown ethx
2005-05-14T13:32:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	killall -9 dhclient3
2005-05-14T13:33:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	send host-name "imafool"
2005-05-14T13:33:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	don't forget ; as a lst latter
2005-05-14T13:35:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	its working fine now. i knew it would be a simple task if i wasnt such a moron
2005-05-14T13:36:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	end of story
2005-05-14T13:37:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i'd add a page to the wiki to save people like me a lot of time, but i still dont quite understand what i did
2005-05-14T13:38:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	dhclient3 is program that get's IP from dhcp server
2005-05-14T13:38:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf is configuration file for that program
2005-05-14T13:39:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	putting the hostname in ServerName in etc/cups/client.conf still doesnt work. all is for naught
2005-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	do u know anything about networking?
2005-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	obviously not
2005-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	then how could i explain enything to u? :)
2005-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	cat /etc/resolv.conf
2005-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	oh, i wasn't asking you to. i thought it was well understood that i was a lost cause
2005-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i have a nameserver, 210.15.254.240
2005-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	so u see, u have nameservers of ur ISP
2005-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	if u put a name in /etc/cups/client.conf it will search that name on couple of places
2005-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	first it will look in /etc/hosts to find it there, if it isn't there, it will contact namservers
2005-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	nameservers can't know anything about ur local network and they won't have that name too
2005-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i thought the nameserver is what resolves internet url's
2005-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	yes, that's name resolving, conecting IP with hostname
2005-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	yeah, but i want to do that locally...
2005-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u have two options
2005-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u can enter all ur hosts in /etc/hosts
2005-05-14T13:45:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	or u can setup local DNS
2005-05-14T13:45:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i now know that my router definitely knows my ubuntu machine's hostname. do i have to go a further step to let other computers on the LAN to be able to use that information?
2005-05-14T13:45:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	read again what i just said
2005-05-14T13:45:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i can't set up hosts because i'm on DHCP, yeah?
2005-05-14T13:45:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	well... right
2005-05-14T13:46:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	so u can setup dns on ur router
2005-05-14T13:46:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	and connect it with dhcp
2005-05-14T13:46:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	is that hard? am i better off just biting the bullet and switching to static IP's?
2005-05-14T13:46:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	with dhcp-dns
2005-05-14T13:46:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	well, it isn't simple :)
2005-05-14T13:48:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	i'm sorry. i didnt realise what i was asking to do wasnt trivial. i thought i was just a newb. forget it
2005-05-14T13:49:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	just editing dhcpd.conf was easy enough to get my router to get the client's hostname, i thought it would be equally trivial to get other computes on the lan to be able to refer to that hostname
2005-05-14T13:49:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	i don't know what ur router is
2005-05-14T13:49:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	i just know it sends public DNS, and they don't know anything about ur local network
2005-05-14T13:50:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	what if i put "hostname@localhost"?
2005-05-14T13:50:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	? :))
2005-05-14T13:51:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	man.. do u have email?
2005-05-14T13:51:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	yeah. i have email. thats the one part of networking i CAN get working
2005-05-14T13:51:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	so, is it hotmail@hotmail.com or jacq@hotmail.com?
2005-05-14T13:52:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	so.. it's allways username@hostname
2005-05-14T13:52:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	localhost IS hostname
2005-05-14T13:52:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	it's a special hostname, referring to local host :)
2005-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	in /etc/hosts u need something like:
2005-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	192.168.0.2 gaetway
2005-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	192.168.0.4 mywindowsbox
2005-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	ivoks	but that's for static IP
2005-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	etc... then will ping gateway work
2005-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	u have 4 machines! dhcp is overhead
2005-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	i give up on u
2005-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	ivoks	jacquesmerde	ur router doesn't translate hostnames, DNS does that, and u are using public DNS
