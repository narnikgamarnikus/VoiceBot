2008-10-06T15:03:00.000Z	rebel_kid		iknonia, that was my isp dieing, and my secondary nick is my away nick, once i ghosted my standard i /nick 'ed
2008-10-06T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	still don't need an "away" nick
2008-10-06T15:04:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	i dont use it in this chan
2008-10-06T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	you just did, hence the message
2008-10-06T15:05:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	that was no different than an alternate nick in case of ghost or nick takeover
2008-10-06T15:05:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	it just happened to be |zZzZ
2008-10-06T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	nice changes for away / sleeping / alternative nics are not really appriciated
2008-10-06T15:07:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	that was not a nick change for sleeping or away, that was my internet dieing and rebel_kid disconnecting, then x chat reconnecting under an alternate because rebel_kid was a ghost, after ghosting i nicked back to rebel_kid that had nothing to do with being away or sleeping
2008-10-06T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	why are you arguing this, it was just a polite request
2008-10-06T15:08:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	i found it rude, seeing as how the message "rebel_kid quit(nick collission from services)" came first
2008-10-06T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	thats your issue to deal with then, just because your connection died, you had another "away" nick idling
2008-10-06T15:09:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	you would have seen the same messages had the alternate been rebel_kid_
2008-10-06T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	yes
2008-10-22T19:34:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ls -la
2008-10-22T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	what user name are you trying to use
2008-10-22T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	what is the exact password prompt say
2008-10-22T20:08:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	"An application wants to access the private key "id_rsa" but it is locked"
2008-10-22T20:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	check the permissions on your id_dsa file in your home dir
2008-10-22T20:10:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	permissions are all me and its in ~/.ssh
2008-10-22T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	check what the permissions are though, not the owner
2008-10-22T20:11:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	1743
2008-10-22T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	change it to 600 for me please
2008-10-22T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	it may sound silly but key permissions are very fussy
2008-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	same story
2008-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ok - so what command are you using to ssh in
2008-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	sorry to be specific, but it helps to know
2008-10-22T20:13:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	ssh freecoders@67.42.176.67 -p 2222
2008-10-22T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ok try this ssh -vv freecoders@67.42.176.67 -p 2222
2008-10-22T20:15:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	same story only with a lot more readout
2008-10-22T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	pastebint the output please.
2008-10-22T20:16:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	http://pastebin.ca/1233864
2008-10-22T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	give me a minue to look
2008-10-22T20:17:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	np
2008-10-22T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ahh there we have it
2008-10-22T20:17:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	wow that was fast
2008-10-22T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	your key is not valid
2008-10-22T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	the locked message is a read herring
2008-10-22T20:18:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	local or remote? and how do i create a new one
2008-10-22T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	well this looks like your local private key is messed up
2008-10-22T20:18:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	can it be recreated?
2008-10-22T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	it also looks like it's trying to use id_rsa rather than id_dsa
2008-10-22T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	what is in your ~.ssh dir
2008-10-22T20:21:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	id_rsa  id_rsa.keystore  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
2008-10-22T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ahh ha, thats interesting
2008-10-22T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	so the application wants to use dsa but you've got an rsa key
2008-10-22T20:22:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	i cant even remember making that key, i just finished setup on the remote, didnt do a thing to the local
2008-10-22T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	run "file" against rsa_id
2008-10-22T20:23:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	and it is asking for "id_rsa"
2008-10-22T20:23:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ahh sorry, I thought it was asking for id_dsa, my mistake
2008-10-22T20:24:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	got two no such file or directory errors (one for against and one for rsa_id) must have run your command wrong
2008-10-22T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	one moment please
2008-10-22T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	look at the first line of your id_rsa look like this -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
2008-10-22T20:27:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	yeah looks exactly like that
2008-10-22T20:27:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	ehck for spaces at the end of that line
2008-10-22T20:28:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	none
2008-10-22T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	look at lines 09/12 in your pastebin poit and it looks like the descriptor line is on 4 lines rather than one
2008-10-22T20:30:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	(assuming im understanding) i have a single line descriptor with no spaces at the end
2008-10-22T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	well yes and no, your errors conflict with line 70
2008-10-22T20:31:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	im a bit confused by this, im not sure what your telling me
2008-10-22T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	I'll go through it with you now, but the bottom line is your key "looks" corrupt
2008-10-22T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	got the pastebin
2008-10-22T20:31:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	lets go through it
2008-10-22T20:31:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	got it
2008-10-22T20:32:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	ok
2008-10-22T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	but scroll down to line 56-59 that makes the key look good
2008-10-22T20:33:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	alright
2008-10-22T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	line 70 also shows a valid id_rsa key
2008-10-22T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	followign so far ?
2008-10-22T20:34:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	following
2008-10-22T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	then go down to 74 - it tries a non-existant key (.ssh/identify) fails on that and moes onto your key (.ssh/id_rsa)
2008-10-22T20:35:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	ok
2008-10-22T20:35:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	76 - it sends the key but something happens as it doesn't like the response/key and moves on to try id_dsa which you don't have and then tries a straight password
2008-10-22T20:35:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	yeah
2008-10-22T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	that something is what can't be explained
2008-10-22T20:36:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	ok, i understand now, but what do i do?
2008-10-22T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	my personal feeling is deelte your key directorys stuff as you've got a few odd files in there, re-create the keys and re-set it up
2008-10-22T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	thats my personal feeling, it will only take 10 minutes
2008-10-22T20:37:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	your talking locally right? and just rm -rf the ~/.ssh directory?
2008-10-22T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	not the whole directory no
2008-10-22T20:38:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	just all the keys?
2008-10-22T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	you'll need to do this locally, but you'll need to get your new public key put on the target server
2008-10-22T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	yeah, just the keys
2008-10-22T20:39:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	id_rsa.pub is a key i sent over from the remote, delete that and resend?
2008-10-22T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	delete *rsa* - recreate new private/public keys and re-send the .pub key
2008-10-22T20:40:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	so i need to create new keys remote and local?
2008-10-22T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	no you need to create a public and a private key locally and put the public key you created locally on any host you wantt o access remotly in the authorized_keys file on the remote host in your home/.sh dir
2008-10-22T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rebel_kid	you may find this useful http://www.laubenheimer.net/ssh-keys.shtml
2008-10-22T20:41:00.000Z	rebel_kid	ikonia	ty
