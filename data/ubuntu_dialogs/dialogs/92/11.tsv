2011-03-26T20:22:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	and once that gets done, you can run `sudo fdisk -l 2>&1 | pastebinit` and paste the address.

2011-03-26T20:54:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	actually, run this: `umount /mnt ; fsck /dev/sda1`
2011-03-26T20:54:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	it might just be that your disk is corrupt.
2011-03-26T20:58:00.000Z	et-0nline	cipherboy	dev/sda1/is mounted warning if you continued you will cause severe filesystem damage
2011-03-26T20:58:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	stop it;

2011-03-26T21:02:00.000Z	et-0nline	cipherboy	yes
2011-03-26T21:02:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	try this: `ls /` and post the output.

2011-03-26T21:04:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	try: `mkdir /media/hd`
2011-03-26T21:05:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	now run: `mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /media/md`
2011-03-26T21:06:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	yes. do you not have all the slashes that I added?
2011-03-26T21:07:00.000Z	et-0nline	cipherboy	there is no md its hd
2011-03-26T21:08:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	`mount -t proc none /media/hd` is what I meant.
2011-03-26T21:08:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	now run: `mount -t bind /dev /media/hd/dev`
2011-03-26T21:09:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	and then: `mount-t bind /dev/pts /media/hd/dev/pts`
2011-03-26T21:09:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	what is the output of `ls /media/hd`?
2011-03-26T21:10:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	but no dev?
2011-03-26T21:10:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	do you have a separate /home?
2011-03-26T21:11:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	how is that possible? no wonder it doesn't boot. Do you have a /home folder there? Also, do you have a separate /home?
2011-03-26T21:11:00.000Z	et-0nline	cipherboy	actually if i know this fscking grub will take so long time i will reinstall the hole shit again
2011-03-26T21:12:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	more or less, you need to chroot into your old install, run update-grub and it should be fixed.
2011-03-26T21:13:00.000Z	et-0nline	cipherboy	what to do now
2011-03-26T21:14:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	google how to set up a chroot on linux, chroot into your install, make sure you are root, and then run `update-grub2`
2011-03-26T21:14:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	then reboot into the ubuntu, run `sudo update-grub2`, reboot and everything might be fixed.
2011-03-26T21:15:00.000Z	cipherboy	et-0nline	sorry, I have to go.
